The Museum of Egyptian Antiquities,Speciality Museums,4.5,"Midan El Tahrir Geographical Society Building, Cairo 11511 Egypt","This famous museum houses the world’s largest collection of ancient Egyption artifacts (more than 120,000 items on display) featuring the famous Tutankhamun collection with its beautiful gold death mask and sarcophagus and the royal Mummy room, which houses an additional eleven Pharaonic dignitaries.","['Must see place', 'We went on a guided tour. The place is always very busy of course but very very interesting.  Full of artifacts,  stones, sarcophagus,  place to see the famous mummy of Tutankhamen.  You can spend days inside it. Better to target the areas and see the best of them. Amazing', 'Mind-blowing Cairo', 'Visited the museum as part of a day trip organised for us by Red Sea Star Trips in Hurghada. The artifacts on show are incredible and, of course, the star of the show is the Tutankhamen room with his casket and death mask. Simply stunning. Our guide, Mohamed looked after us all day and was extremely knowledgeable. Absolutely recommend a visit and if you need a guide in Cairo, Mohamed is your man. A great day out, never to be forgotten.', 'Great day', 'Very nice museum it has so many amazing artifacts, the building itself also so beautiful , most of the exhibit have description in Arabic and English it was so easy .', 'Great Museum To Visit', ""We decided to visit the Tutankhamun Exhibit in the  Egyptian Museum in Cairo. It was a lot to take in. The chamber room the housed the most treasured artifacts such as his gold burial mask, inner coffins and other treasures of Tutankhamun didn't allow photography. I would have love to share those pictures. Here are some pictures of some of the other artifacts that was in his tomb, like busts of himself, bed chairs, foot rests, storage boxes, etc. There were also other preserved mummies in the museum.  I thought I'd be creeped out but I wasn't. Great museum to visit"", 'Fascinating Collection but Needs Better Organisation - The Egyptian Museum Review', ""Our visit to The Egyptian Museum in Cairo was an intriguing experience. The museum houses an incredible array of ancient Egyptian treasures, offering a deep dive into the country's rich history. Each exhibit is a testament to Egypt's remarkable past.However, we did find the internal organisation of the museum somewhat lacking. The layout appeared disorganised, with no clear logical sequence to the exhibits. This made navigating the museum and fully appreciating its contents more challenging than expected. Additionally, despite the wealth of historical artifacts, the museum itself seemed a bit neglected and run down, which detracted from the overall experience.While the museum is an absolute must-visit for its invaluable contents, a revamp in its presentation and upkeep could greatly enhance the experience for visitors, ensuring the exhibits are showcased in a manner befitting their significance."", 'Very interesting.', 'Most day tours combine this with the Pyramids. And it is also more enjoyable if you have learnt about Cheops and Old Kingdom and such in the morning from your guide at the Giza plateau.', ""Visit to the 'old' museum"", 'Loved all the artifacts and the building itself...but, considering the amount of people visiting the museum, it could be a bit better maintained, updated, etc..', 'Tutankhamen treasures in all their glory. Awsome', 'Amazing. Tutankhamen treasures in all their glory. Ver y busy and really hot. No air con. Go early to avoid the heat and crowds', 'Fabulous Museum.....amazing history', 'A beautiful facility filled with ancient artifacts. We spent 2 hours with our guide and saw an excellent overview of the museum.  You could spend a day or 2 digesting the history or a quick 2hrs to appreciate the depth of the collection.   Not to be missed as a compliment to the Pyramids.', 'Spectacular museum', 'This is a MUST DO in Cairo.The admission fee is very reasonable (around 10 dollars for tourists) and the museum is jam packed with Egyptian treasures.The highlight is the Tutankhamen display, which includes two gold full burial sarcophagus and many of the items with which the pharaoh was buried with.It is a large museum and was not overcrowded when we visited.There is also an excellent gift shop and cafes within the grounds for refreshments.', 'A museum you should visit.', 'The Egyptian Museum in Cairo, the only one that built as a museum. The room of Tutankhamun, with all its treasures ,Narmar Palette and a lot of master pieces.', 'Time for the move.', 'The move to the new museum can’t come soon enough. It’s fifteen years since our last visit and the museum is tired, dark and dusty, you get the impression that it’s just limping along waiting for the move. The mask has been moved from its original position to a much smaller, hot, dark room which does nothing to display it. More shockingly, I know the beard was damaged a few years ago and had to be replaced but there is definite noticeable deterioration on the lapis lazuli decoration with pieces missing that wasn’t there previously and certainly isn’t shown on official photos. The mask previously was beautiful and gleaming now it looks dusty and in desperate need of some tlc. The most precious artifact in the world deserves better than this.Finally, was pleasantly surprised to see “no tipping” signs at the entrance to the toilets, then went in to the dirtiest, smelliest toilet I encountered in Egypt, I walked straight back out again, the biggest tourist attraction in Cairo !! The management need to get this under control.', 'A bit of a letdown', ""I generally like visiting museums that hold historical artifacts. While the Egypt Museum has many Egyptian antiquities, the museum itself was not very appealing, especially the 1st floor. Lots of areas were poorly lit and dusty. The key attraction was Tutankhamun's treasures. Unfortunately, photography is not allowed in this room."", 'Egyptian history at its finest', 'I wanted to enrich myself with some Egyptian history, especially to see Tutankhamen Gold Mask; which was absolutely fantastic (no photos allowed though).You can spend hours in here and still want to see and know more.I will admit, it was rather hot and crowdy though, so maybe try to visit first thing in the morning.I thoroughly enjoyed myself and think it is worth a visit.', 'Good collection, bad lighting/air flow', ""Nice museum of an abundance of artifacts from every historical period. You are hounded by tour guides who want your business until you enter the museum doors.The lighting is really bad so it's hard to read descriptions at times. Also gets stuffy in areas (no A/C, air flow from open windows). Lot of empty cases as well which we were told are artifacts under maintenance. We were later told by a tour guide half the items in the museum are not real (i.e. papyrus scrolls are modern faded to look authentic but not the real things) so not sure how much of the museum is real.The king tut exhibit is still here, but is moving to GEM at the beginning of next year. It's a tiny smelly wing with a line to enter and no photos allowed."", 'Endless treasures to see', 'So much to see and comprehend, right from the front entrance and into the amazing store of artefacts. Need more time and energy!', 'Must a visit once in the lifetime', 'A must visit place for thouse who are interesting into Egypt acient times.Tremendous collection of any kind of historic relicts whuch could take all day to look.With this kind of collection and number of visitors they could improve information stands , sometimes we felt as in warehouse with thousands years old artefacts.', 'So Much History!', ""A thrilling journey through Egypt's past at Cairo's Museum of Antiquities! Each artifact, from the hand-carved jewelry to the majestic golden sarcophagi, tells a captivating story. The museum's sheer enormity and curation style transport you straight to the heart of Ancient Egypt. Truly, a must-visit landmark.Side notes: clean restrooms, no food or snacks."", 'Awe-inspiring experience', ""Wow, what an amazing collection of some of the world's most valuable antiquities. Standing in front of King Tutankhamon's death mask and stunning jewels is n othing short of amazing."", 'Emo tours', 'Highly recommend this museum,very bigVariety of stuff. We enjoyed our selves wasOnly possible because of emo tours very professional, but thanks to our wonderful Guide Adam he has done an excellent jobWell done to Adam of emo tours', 'The collection deserves better', 'Everything they have is fascinating, however, I was shocked at the state of the museum. No air conditioner, disgusting bathrooms and very little care about the lay out or how to better display the collection.', 'Fabulous!!', 'This museum has so many amazing artefacts that one does not know where to begin. The building itself is also beautiful but in need of restauration.', 'We are walking', 'So much to see. We did not go with a tour group or guide. Most of the exhibits have descriptions in Arabic and English. We were able to explore without being rushed or crowded.', 'Group Tour Stop', ""As much as I would love to have given the museum a five star rating, it just doesn't merit it.  The artifacts are amazing but the sheer volume of what is there to see is overwhelming.  In order to fully appreciate and see all that is on display you would have to spend days, not hours touring, it is a bit overwhelming.  Of course the star of the museum is King Tut and all his treasures.  They are very strict about photography in only two or three areas of the museum, doesn't make sense but it's a thing non the less.  I was fortunate to have seen King Tut's treasures in my youth when it traveled the world but now is only displayed at the museum.  If you ever visit here take your time and take it all in or as much as you can, amazing what the Egyptians achieved 1000's of year ago."", 'Museum was a great starting point of Egypt tour.', 'My wife and I visited the  Egyptian Museum of Antiquities on the first day of our tour of Egypt this past December.  It is located just a short walk from the Ritz Carlton, the hotel where we stayed in Cairo. The museum is not a modern building like the GEM, but it houses some impressive exhibits.  The most spectacular of the museum’s exhibits is the King Tut death mask and sarcophagus, unfortunately no photos allowed.  There are a tremendous amount of exhibits on display.  The museum was a great starting point for our tour of Egypt.', 'Excellent museum', 'Excellent museum . So many antiquities !! Very well displayed . Can take days to see the full extent of the museum. Ticket price reasonable .', 'Must visit Cairo museum', 'The old museum is a place of amazing antiquities viewing opportunities. Ensure you have a knowledgeable guide to firstly get you into the place and then to find your way in and around the building. This is a very old building with many rooms and individual displays which could take days to investigate.Be prepared with a credit card when you arrive as no cash is accepted for payment of your entry fee, 300 Egyptian pounds each, approximately 15 Australian dollars. You will find that no cash entry fee is allowed to any Government run antiquities.', 'Must See despite the crowds', ""This museum is unlike any other with it's vast collection of artifacts from thousands of years ago. Everyone fights the crowds to view King Tut artifacts, but there is so much more. Be prepared for the crowds and you'll have a great time. The same applied to this visit as it was 10 years ago, but now many treasures have been moved to the new museum."", 'Egyptian museum', ""I'm not very impressed. Only Tutankhamun was there..everything else has been moved to the new museum. And I was surprised that you couldn't take a picture of it"", 'Excepcional', 'Best than expected. We went with our guide of all our trip and he explained everything. Huge Museum and very well displayThe hits are at separe roomsThe treasures of Tut are the top of the museum. They are going to be going to the new Museum in Giza', 'The traditional museum experience', 'Currently this museum is in the process of being rearranged as items are moved to the new museum near the pyramids but it has some wonderful gems in it and is worth the visit for the old school atmosphere and how close you can get to some of the items. It will take the day to see everything but it was certainly an experience i shall remember.', 'Great trip to the museum l!', 'Wow so much crammed in to such a limited space! There are some absolutely amazing artefacts to come and see at the egyptian museum! There are two floors and rooms full of everything from real life mummies to the treasures of tutankamun (which you are NOT allowed to take pictures of btw)', 'Lots of Mummies Here!', 'Per the recommendation of my hostel, I visited this museum, National Museum of Egyptian Civilization and of course, the Pyramids of Giza.Entrance fee here is 300 EGP or 10 US$. There are  2 Floors of Exhibits where huge  Statues are located at  the Ground Floor. On the Second Floor are exhibits of many Mummies, some dusty cabinets, etc. I spent  about one hour here.', 'Wonderful Museum', 'Great museum!  So much to see; definitely worth  a trip.  The best part was the mummy exhibit in the basement.', 'Visit it before it is gone.', 'Despite the significant changes happening with exhibits given the new museums in Cairo, this is still the largest and best. A true old school museum. The amount of treasure is just overwhelming. Most tours do not allow sufficient time to investigate this great space. It really needs a full day at least. Ideally the new museum will be able to accommodate all the exhibits rather than have incomplete collections in 3 museums.', 'A great experience with excellent driver', 'I arranged with Rimo tours  for our driver to take us to the airport  via the civilisation museum in Cairo . We had a wonderful driver, Mr Mohammad Radhi pick us up and drive us there, he was an excellent driver in a very clean new vehicle. He told us historical facts about buildings  as we passed them , he spke greatvEnglish and was very knowledgeable and keen for us to know about the sites we saw. He waited with our bags while we visited this excellent museum , full of interesting artifacts from all over Egypt. The room of mummified bodies was vast and truly amazing. Mr Radhi  colllexted us a planned and  whisked us to the airport in good time . No hesitiations  in commending him or the company , Rimo tours who he works for. As  independant  travellers itwas great to discover this company who became our ‘go to ‘ company for drivers whilst in Cairo/ Giza.', 'Fascinating museum with many ancient exhibits', 'The Museum is currently in a state of flux, as some of the treasures have been transferred to the New Egyptian Museum of Civilisation with the mummies, whilst others are filed in the archives and will,  no doubt, go to the new, modern museum adjacent to the Giza plateau and pyramids.Once the new museum opens and there has been sufficient time to organise the items and distribute them to their new homes for display, all will be wonderful.Tutankhamen’s glorious treasures and those of the lesser-known Psussennes are stunning and well worth the visit.  However, there is far more to see than the gold and silver mummy cases, beautiful jewellery and other precious items.   Areas containing priceless artefacts cannot be photographed, though many people tried.  Security guards are ever vigilant!If interested in Egyptology, this is somewhere you would spend a couple of days in!Entry is 300 EGP (approximately £7 or $10 or €10) at the moment.', 'An Excellent Collection', 'Visited on a excursion from Hurghada, this 100+ year old museum is just excellent. It took ages to get in, but it was worth the wait. Its not a very large museum compared to other major museums, but there are quite a lot of notable displays. The most notable display is everything to do with Tutankhamum which includes his mask, his coffin and notable artefacts from his tomb which are found on the upper floor in a small, dark, cramped room, in which you cannot take photos in unless you pay the security guard. Other notable displays include Statue of Djoser, Menkaure Triad Statue, Statue of Khafre, Statue of Mentuhotep II, Statue of Osiris, Statue of Rameses II, Colossal statuary group of Amenhotep III, Coffin of Akhenaten, Funerary Mask of Tuya, 2 famous Pyramidions, 2 Egyptian Mummies and many decorated coffins. There is so much too see and so much history behind each display. Its worth spending 2 hours in the actual museum. To get in is a very long waiting time as it is very popular with tourists and tour groups. However, this attraction just cannot be missed.', 'Atmospheric', 'This was my third visit over many years and there is still something atmospheric about coming here. Clearly some items have been removed to be put in the Grand Egyptian Museum (opening January 2024...maybe) (GEM) but there are still may many items to see and wander around. As I am sure many commentators have said not everything is labeled and may be described as higgldly piggidly but that gives it the atmosphere it has had for many years. Imporatnt point for potential visitors, as of the date of this review, the Tutankamun face mask, his coffins and other items from his tomb are on display here and still astound. I suppose they will move to the GEM but currently here and not to be missed.', 'Must See', 'You have visit for the entire Cairo experience, not just head off to the Pyramids in Giza.  Get a tour guide to focus on your interests and available time.  Interview until you find one you understand well.  This is a massive place so use your time wisely.   Our later visit to Luxor and Valley of Kings would not have been as rewarding without the museum time.  Unfortunately, the new museum was not yet open.', 'Egyptian treasures galore', ""The museum has tons of Egyptian artifacts, including from the Tut collection.  It's very crowded and you can spend all day here if you're the type that like to immerse yourself into everything, so plan accordingly."", 'History paradise', 'As expected, this museum was suuuuper interesting to visit and I think one of my favorite museum trips so far! An insane number of artifacts 😍', 'Fantastic pleace', ""This museum is amazing it's a unique opportunity to come face to face with this ancient rulers and gain insight into the mummification process, , Remember to allocate sufficient time for your visit."", 'Great museum still hosting Tutenkhamun until the new museum completes', ""We had to fit this visit in on way to airport so had bags and time constrained.  First point flight bags can be left for a tip at the left luggage cabin which is inside the museum complex (bags need to go through security screening at main gate) but outside the museum building near the cafeteria.  The museum itself is fab not least because it is still currently (Sept 23) housing the Tutankhamun treasures, although lots of other things to see when those get relocated to the new museum being completed late in 2023? on West Bank near Pyramids.  We quickly realised that to make the most of our two hours we'd need a guide.We spoke to one of the security guards in the museum and he contacted a guide on our behalf who showed up within a few minutes.  Our guide Osama see details in photo was great complete contrast to some of the scammers who set up as guides around these attractions.  He spoke good English, gave us the context of what we were seeing, was genuinely knowledgeable and really focused us on the interesting and unusual things to see there, highly recommend him."", 'A bit disorganized, but some interesting exhibits', ""This museum is a little like what exploring Indiana Jones' warehouse would be like. A lot of crates strewn about, a lot of exhibit cases empty, a lot of dust, intermixed with some really cool stuff.  My advice is to skip this museum and go to the Museum of Egyptian Civilization.  I think it's new, very well done, and it has an absolutely amazing collection of Egyptian mummies in pristine condition.  I actually went to the Egyption Civilization Museum by accident looking for this museum, but I was glad I did.  And FYI, there is nowhere to buy water inside the museum, and if you leave once in, your ticket is no longer valid."", 'Extremely Crowded!', 'Go as early as possible. It is very crowded. The pieces from King Tut are incredible. A must see. It is also very hot inside. Be prepared. Water.', 'Cannot enter with a Kirpan (for Sikhs)', ""Can't enter if you are a Sikh. This is just for information purposes. The museum security will not let you in wearing a Kirpan. The lady security officers were extremely rude. However, the person in charge was really respectful and explained that we can put our daggers in a deposit box and have them back after wards. However we declined due to the ladies being so rude to my wife."", 'Excellent', 'This place is worth visiting, it is absolutely brilliant - interesting, informative, friendly staff. Highly recomment a stop here.', 'Heart breaking', ""It was heartbreaking to see all these unique and wonderful ancient pieces treated with this carelessness, from the moment you step inside, some dead palm trees and lack of care of exterior and interior of the historical museum we tried to ignore the surroundings and focus on enjoying the art but we couldn't turn our eyes off the dust on the coffins, we were told by our guide that the mummies were moved the civilization museum, I read online that there is evening opening time and morning time but the evening opening is not true, at least when we were there ,you can only visit 8am to 4pm. The museum is 2 floors , some pieces has info texts written in English and French but in very small writing that is hardly read, we saw a young girl touching a statue for a photo and the security man sitting at the end of the corridor didn't take any action! We left early because it was too sad to watch, luckily our scheduled next activity for evening was food tours by Mila, truly phenomenal experience in local Cairo life and food that wiped out all the frustration me and my husband had at the museum."", 'Until  new museum opens, it is worth the time!', 'When I booked my trip to Egypt, I had hoped that the new museum would be opening.  After my trip… don’t hold your breath!  So, I went to the old museum and was pleasantly surprised at the items still in residence.  Many of Tut’s tomb items now reside in the new unopened museum and can be seen only by “special” invite ….. no idea how to get the invite!  However, the old museum looks worn, but the items are still amazing.  Jewelry, statues, sarcophagus, tablets and fabulous  other tomb’s items and all you would expect to see in a 1st class museum.  I took about 2 Hrs and was happy.']",30.0444196,31.2357116

The details of the mosque are intricate, and the chandelier displays inside are mesmerizing.Outside, there is a viewpoint where you can see the pyramids on a clear day, but not during the time of our visit. It was hazy.It also features France's gift to Egypt in return of giving them an obelisk of Luxor Temple. Since the clock doesn't work, it's clear the Egypt got shafted and I guess it was at that moment the Egyptians have learned that the only people they should trust with clocks are the Swiss."", 'Stunning', 'Such a beautiful mosque adorned with silver and gives the most stunning panoramic view of Cairo.

It can be seen as a somewhat arrogant attitude. But that's often the case in monotheistic religions: We alone know.The mosque is impressive but strangely devoid of life. It's like a museum for an absent god, forgotten by everyone, especially the photo-hungry visitors.My recommendation: Visit one of Cairo's many other mosques, where the faithful gather both to pray and to chill. There is life and presence here."", 'Grand Mosque', 'The history and grandeur are magnificent. The actual mosque is not that compelling with the simple finishes and adornments.

An impressive structure dominating this part of the city. The citadel area is a great location to visit as you have a number of mosques plus church and synagogue too. This for me was the best. The stunning courtyard and French clock tower lead you in to the beautiful interior and ceiling. The chandeliers and the lighting arrangement really make the interior shine. The details and workmanship is so very impressive. Outside you get some impressive views of Cairo city from this side and you can also spot the nearby Sultan Hassan mosque from here. Which you will no doubt be visiting. Also some nice exterior photos can be had here. The area also has a police and military museum but I think the latter is under renovation.

It has been a while so I will not remember some of the places\' names and such, this is a review for the whole experience.We booked the ""classic Egypt"" cruise package with ""Classic Holidays"" website, which is a trading name of the co-operative travel consortium. 10 night total, 7 in the Nile and 3 in Cairo.The booking itself was straightforward through the website but as it was our first trip outside of Europe we were a bit nervous we had made the right choice. The website looks a bit ""old"" and the company didn\'t send all the paperwork in the post until quite close to the travel date so we were a bit anxious and afraid we had been scammed (newbies I guess!) but they did reassured un the phone that all was ok and indeed it ended up being a genuine company and all went smooth.Our flight was direct UK (Heathrow) to Cairo from where we took a second flight to Luxor. First night was in a Luxor hotel and then we transferred to the cruise in the morning. We were in the MS Esadora ship. She was a bit old at the time (I hear she has been refurbished since then) but we still found it comfortable and good value for money, even if you can see her age. Nice small pool on top deck where we kept our feet cool while drinking some beers in the afternoons. It was lovely to hear the calls to prayer all alongside the Nile on sundown. Good cold beers and aceptable coffee on the bars.The room was of good size and comfortable. The bathroom was a bit small but still clean and had enough facilities.The staff in the ship were polite, maybe a bit ""too"" polite with myself so I had my husband deal with asking for the drinks. If you are a bit uncomfortable with male attention as I am get a male companion to ""talk for you"".We had the all inclusive so I cannot comment on the drinks\' prices. The food was acceptable (nothing to write books about), it was obvious that it was cooked to fit most palates and quite ""westernised"". We would have liked to eat more local style food but we understand ""exotic"" food might not be for everyone. We found something nice to eat everyday so no complaints really. There were veggie options daily and safe halal food (mostly chicken and beef), salads, pasta, rice, puddings and fruit. It was a bit repetitive though but we were fed and we didn\'t get sick at all the whole 10 days so a win in my eyes.Our included excursions were: Karnak Temple, Aswan High Dam, Colossi of Memnon, Luxor Temple, Temple of Hatshepsut, Temple of Philae, Boat trip around Elephantine Island, Temple of Medinat Hatu, Kom Ombo Temple, Unfinished Obelisk.The optional excursions were (for an extra fee): Abu Simbel, Hot Air Balloon, Sound and Light Show. Of these we chose to go to Abu Simbel by road (through the Sahara), which was an amazing experience as we got to see the dawn (the bus stopped for us to enjoy that and take pictures), we saw a couple of mirages but if we come back we will take the air trip there next time as it was a lot of hours by bus.Sadly neither the valley of the kings or the valley of the queens were included in this package so we have something to go back for""Our Egyptian guide was Michael who was super nice. He put us in contact with a private guide in Cairo as Cairo was 3 nights of B&B at the Le Méridien Pyramids hotel but we were ""free"" to do as we pleased the rest of the day, so we chose to get a guide by ourselves (I\'m sure they are friends or family and get a ""commission"" for sending tourists to them). The hotel was OK, patchy WIFI like we had experience everywhere else. The best part was the views of the pyramids from the bar! Our private guide organised excursions for us to the Egyptian Museum, the Mosque of Muhammad Ali and Old Cairo where we visited a Coptic church and a synagogue. All but the food we ate and the tickets to the museum was included in what we paid the guide, who drove us around.For our next trip to Egypt we will avoid Cairo in favour of staying longer in Luxor. If you are like us and are more interested in the pharaonic era, Cairo maybe can be a pass. Don\'t get me wrong it is impressive but other than the pyramids and the sphinxe we would have preferred to pass on the rest and see the Queens and Kings valleys instead.On the last day, transfer to the airport from the hotel was smooth and flight back also good.We liked this company because all prices were transparent. All was included in the all inclusive cruise (with drinks) so other than tips/optional activities and whether we wanted to but stuff during the excursions, we didn\'t have to pay anything extra as promised. Cairo as explained had hotel, breakfast and transfers from and to the airport included. All in all an impressively good holiday for how ""little"" we paid (around £3000 for both of us back in 2019).We are already planning our next trip back with this same company!My main advice for anyone going to Egypt for the first time is: - Buy species if you like to cook like us, the saffron if ridiculously cheap (compared to here anyway!). - Wash / sanitize your hands all-the-time to avoid travellers\' diarrhoea but specially after handling cash. - Do NOT give the children money when they ask for it or you will not get rid of them!  - Get plenty of American one dollar bills for tipping.- Everyone says you should haggle... we did not at all and no one was offended and even by not haggling and ""overpaying"" for everything we still found Egypt to be very cheap.- Take a scarf with you to cover your hair (for women) if you plan on visiting a mosque.', 'Movenpick Royal Lily. Amazing cruise, horrible staff! Great tour company!', ""We booked the Movenpick Royal Lily from Aswan to Luxor. To be honest, it's quite an impressive setup by Movenpick. Spacious cabins & a great sun deck & everything seemed to be painted quite well.We booked this via Imperial Egypt Tours & they were amazing! Arranged & organised everything to suit our schedule. The guide on our first day to Abu Simbel was Mohamed & he was nothing but brilliant! From the second day on, the cruise & the excursions were conducted by the guide Mahmoud & he was pretty great as well.The reason for my 3 stars though was the staff at the Royal Lily. They were extremely unprofessional & unhelpful. The manager Hani was trying a bit but the standards were nothing close to that of a Movenpick establishment.We walked into our cabins of course expecting them to be impeccable, as we obviously were paying quite a bit of money for this. To our disbelief, we found strands of hair everywhere on our bed sheets, mind you this wasn't just one or two, it was everywhere. Our guess was that the housekeeping team tried to get away with just making the bed after the previous guests left without changing the sheets! Which is absolutely unacceptable! Though when complained they were changed, it should've never happened in the first place! It was the same with the bathroom, found quite more than a few stranda if hair as if it were just wiped down & not carefully cleaned.We did receive a very brief apology from the manager Hani but that was really about it. Reason number 2 for the 3 stars is again the unprofessionalism of the staff. I was at the sun deck & I clearly asked the staff there whether I could bring my own bottle of single malt to the deck as this being a Movenpick had no single malts in their menu to our surprise! But I, being me, always carry a bottle or two of so gle matls with me! The staff clearly told me that it was okay to bring my own single malt to the sun deck, which later I found out was a miscommunication, which is fine. But this being a Movenpick establishment & not having a single, single malt is quite weird. & what really made me annoyed was the fact that they were charging a corkage for me to have my own single malt. Which again would've been fair if they had any, which wasn't the case, given that we have no access to any single malts in the water for days! & I wasn't about to pay even a penny to open a bottle of single malt & have 2 glasses for a half an hour which was all the time I had at that time before dinner.The manager Hani again tried to be a little helpful but the F&B person of unknown designation Sayed was insistent that the full corkage has to be charged no matter the circumstances!"", 'Amazing adventure on the Nile River', 'Just finished the Uniworld SS Sphinx Nile River cruise   This was an amazing 5 star experience You do have to be patient and keep the journey in context (there will be some waiting while driving around, you will see some poverty, you will encounter some aggressive peddlers) but it is an amazing adventureThe sites visited are tremendous the Egyptologist guides are superb   The food on the ship is 5 star   The pre/post stay at 4 seasons is luxury Uniworld does an excellent job of attending to many many little details that allows you to sit back and enjoy the adventure There was a perfect mix of adventures/sites to relaxation on the ship Schedule/times change as you proceed but Uniworld gives constant daily updates on the itinerary and what to expect', 'Gharb Suhail', 'Nice views , history & silence Gharb Suhail is a calm village near Aswan where you can swim , fishing , enjoy silence & landscaping', 'Fabulous Nile River Cruise', 'My wife and I went on a fabulous Nike River cruise this past December.

We were on the Nebu, a forty cabin modern boat.  Our stateroom was the largest we have had on any of our river or ocean cruises.  We visited the temples at Luxor, Karnak, the Valley of the Kings and Edfu.  We cruised down the Nile to Aswan and visited the High Dam, Abu Simbel, Philae, and the Old Cataract Hotel.

The food on this cruise was mostly inedible. The chefs have no idea how to cook western food, which is 100% of the guests. All the meat dishes were overcooked, chewy and bland and tasteless. Unfortunately this was the worst food I have ever seen. I survived for five days by making bread roll sandwiches for lunch and dinner. Lucky the Heineken was cold.The ships are all old the bathrooms are tiny with no individual shower. I’m 185cm tall with two bad knees and had to climb in to slippery bath, where the overhead shower nearly touched my head.Cruising the Nile itself is slow and boring.

I certainly wouldn’t be booking with this company again and I would strongly suggest others don’t eithe. We fully explained prior to our trip and even discussed it with the cruise boat on the Nile that we are vegetarian. Yet they were serving beef pizzas to us. The all-inclusive element was not. There was not provided afternoon tea on the boat consisted of a small sponge, cake and some biscuits That is not a afternoon tea the all-inclusive on the drinks wasn’t there either they provided no juices when we requested some fresh carrot juice, boiled carrots, mix it with water and then served us that there was some sort of disgusting sludge.

The cruise is overpriced for what it is.Make the customer feel special, that’s what luxury lines do.I don’t like to compare to,our ship lines, but AMA, and Scenic do a better job.And Seabourn, Regent and Silverseas could really help Mayflower fine tune their customer approach.The pool was green the last day of our trip, and although it was cleaned, it wasn’t very nice to use.The constant reach out for tipping for service is one reason I would never return. Everyone wants you to,buy junky souvenirs. It takes away from the experience.

I paid 50 USD but may be one can bargain for a lower price.', 'Movenpick MS Darakum - long Nile cruise', ""This is a review of the accommodation on the Mövenpick MS Darakum, not of the tours on offer or the service. Most reviews of the MS Darakum are about 10 years old. The MS Darakum was first launched in 2008. Since then the ship has been through a lot of wear and tear and it seems that Mövenpick/Accor are not maintaining standards. The Mövenpick dock in Cairo was a filthy combination of tiled steps, dirty carpet, artificial grass and rubbish. The gangway is a metal plank with one rope as the railing. Not a great start to an expensive cruise.MS Darakum has 5 decks and NO lifts. It’s therefore not suitable for travelers with mobility issues. Decor is a Moroccan theme (go figure, this is Egypt)! Cabins on the upper deck have superb views of the Nile with large panoramic windows but these can be blocked by neighboring boats when moored. There is a narrow flap window on one side for fresh air but the hinge was broken and it was difficult to open. The cabin had a musty smell so fresh air was essential.Most cabins are about 20 sqm. Cabin decor is either a garish red or green. The blockout curtains are now faded. Cabins are furnished with large twin beds that can be configured as a king bed. The mattress and high-quality sheets were very comfortable. Furnishings include a bedside table, built-in desk, a long bench for luggage and one worn sitting chair by the window. There also was a small fridge, flat screen TV (with 700 channels and only 2 in English), kettle and cups, tiny safe (too small for an ipad or laptop) and wardrobe (with broken hinges). It was difficult to find power points to recharge devices. There was one EU and one UK socket under the desk. Wifi was patchy or unavailable at times. It pays to buy an Egyptian SIM card at the airport. The ensuite is a significant 30cm (12 inches) step up from the main room. It was recently renovated with a back and white tiled theme. Shower was over the old bathtub\xa0(tricky for those with mobility issues) and basin was a beautiful white alabaster bowl. Most annoying was the lack of a toilet roll holder or soap dish. The new hairdryer was great. Fresh towels and toiletries were provided twice a day. Service from the crew on this boat is exceptional.Most of the public areas were clean and well presented with the exception of the rear sun deck on the upper deck. This was used to store paint, building materials and old mattresses.  Some painting was done during the cruise which caused unpleasant paint fumes. The tender boats at the rear of the ship also contained rubbish. The small plunge pool (depth 1.6 m) on the upper deck is deep enough to cool off on extreme hot days. However the ladder into the pool is badly rusted at the main joints and needs maintenance. The top deck was sometimes excessively hot as the shade canopies were too small. One large canopy would be a great improvement.Seating in the main restaurant on the bottom deck was crowded. It was difficult to squeeze between the large round tables to the buffet. Seating was semi-fixed but not everyone wants to sit with the same 8 guests for 14 days. Unfortunately, ventilation was very poor in the restaurant. Almost all passengers were coughing heavily by the end of the cruise. It would be a big improvement if the bar/disco area in the restaurant (which was never used) could be converted into extra table space. It was a relief that on some evenings dinners were served in the open air on the top deck. The crew and the level of service on the MS Darakum were exceptional. The  guides were also fantastic with their indepth knowledge of the sites. Food was a different buffet most days. The route from Cairo to Aswan offers a superb opportunity to see the major sites of Egypt. However the boat itself deserves more love and tours on this boat are expensive. It's high time that the management of Mövenpick/Accor in Europe did a much overdue inspection and update."", 'A great way to see the Nile and its treasures', 'Everything was wonderful, from the friendly, helpful staff to the very comfortable accommodation to the tasty and varied food.

Look at the picture below.The good sides of the cruises were certainly the time spend on excursion sites, especially the temples along the nile river. Although, the reverse side of the medal were forced shopping trips to papyrus shops and perfume shops we did not ask for (nor were they announced in the description). So obviously we lost a lot of time on site.Food was quite all right with full continental breakfast, and always nice diversity for lunch and dinner.

Didnt eat normal food for rest of the trip.Instead of accepting and apologizing they kept making excuses and put it on something else. They don’t provide any drink whatsoever, not even water. Drinks were crazy expensive. Glass of lemon juice was $4usd.You dont always get the Nile view btw. When its docked in Aswan and Luxor, which is most part of the trip its docked next to the other ship and the people from other ship can see you inside so you will always have to keep the curtains closed.

The food can only be described as adequate but is bland at best.I appreciate it is a totally different cruise experience to what we are used to, but was surprised at just how different it was. One surprising thing which I was not aware of, was the practice of tying lots of boats together side by side when docked, sometimes as many as 7 across. So to get to the Royal Viking we sometimes had to walk across several other boats. This also meant that sleep wasn’t possible sometimes due to the constant noise of generators of several boats running all night. There was also a strong smell of diesel fumes. We also had to keep our cabin curtains closed when tied up, as we didn’t want the passengers in the boat alongside looking directly into our cabin.The staff are very attentive but are constantly on the make for extra tips, even though we paid £54 upfront which was for tips. Needless to say I didn’t give any extra.I was also staggered at the sheer numbers of boats operating on this section of the Nile, I believe there are over 380.On a positive we did some lovely trips thanks to our tour guide Abdou and we met some lovely people on board.Would I do it again?

Roasted chicken cooking on the edge of the Nile at night, our two boys collecting fire wood for a fire, our boys learning how to make Egyptian tea, telling stories and jokes at night, hearing the water lap against the felucca at night, visiting a small village along the Nile and feeling as if the world had stopped moving, swimming in the Nile, our boys teaching the crew how to play chess, eating delicious food, and countless other memories keep coming back to us. It was truly a magnificent experience for our whole family. As I type this I am reminded of the first night we met Ramdan on the Nile and we were so tired from our overland trip. He greeted us with a smile and good food and a birthday cake for my husband, as he had noted this in his passport. He dropped us off at the train station in Luxor at the end of our felucca trip to go on to Cairo that night. Our last image of Ramdan and his kind face was two platforms away from us, waving to us and then he was gone as trains rushed by.Thank you Ramdan and your crew! Thank you.Note: If you are looking for a fancy cruise on the Nile this experience is not for you yet if you want to find the gem within Nile that is truly Egypt, please contact Ramdan. He will take good care of you and your children.Felucca TripsCaptain Ramdan Kopany+20 111 093 8727FB: Ramdan Kopany', 'The life-giving river', 'As we know Nile River gives the life in a barren desert. First I saw it in Cairo, it was impressive. Later we went to Luxor temple by small boat, it was very exciting. Finally an old dream of us came true: we travelled on a cruise ship from Luxor to Aswan. Nile was very peaceful and beautiful, we enjoyed every moment of it. We visited the Aswan Dam. Nile River was huge like a sea at the dam. It’s marvellous! Must-see!', 'Awe  inspiring ....', 'So interesting to hear about the Nile and the influence it had on history.Did a Nile cruiseon MS Latraviata - which was wonderful ..... see other review.Many hotels we stayed at had Nile river views .... Also caught a little, brightly coloured,  river taxi from lunch to hotel. Fabulous.Bit disappointing to see the amount of rubbish floating in this majestic river.', 'MS RENAISSANCE', 'We Have just returned from a 2 week holiday in Hurgarda, booked through Travelodeal, this was our second booking, as the first one was cancelled due to Easyjet cancelling our outbound flight, after leaving us sitting on the tarmac at Gatwick for 2 hours.  Our new booking included a change to our 7 day Nile cruise boat, to the MS RENAISSANCE, advertised as a 5* luxury liner, this could not be further from the truth, as the boat, at best was no more than 3*, on arriving at our cabin, we found the cabin  dirty with a live electric socket hanging off the wall, the decor was very dated and tired, the shower blocked, and television only seemed to work in Luxor, to add insult to injury our rep on the boat, Ahmed  informed us that there would be a compulsory £35 pp tip for the crew, we were also told that failure to pay would mean that we would have to carry our own luggage off the boat at the end of the cruise, I am registered disabled which would have made this extremely difficult, in conclusion our other weeks stay at the Swisss in hotel in Hurgarda was Fabulous', 'What use travel agents?', ""We booked a cruise on MS Royal Esadora after considerable research amongst all boats available for Nile Cruises. I received notification by email of a change of boat with very little notice and very limited options. No reason was given for this last minute change. Nile boats moor alongside each other and we actually had to walk through the Royal Esadora whilst moored at Aswan. Although the facilities on both vessels are given as 5 star this is a statement of content and not quality. It was immediately obvious that the MS Semiramis III was not of a high quality as the Royal Esadora. Further, Sunrise vessels do not moor in Luxor but, someway outside leaving no options for exploring Luxor on foot. There could be many reasons for being switched with little notice but the boat was obviously operational and full. This leaves a rather unpleasant realisation that the 8 people who were bumped off the Royal Esadora at the last minute were considered expendable by Mid Counties Co-Op. Rather than fight for our rights you allowed us to be replaced by another party - unacceptable.The transfer between Luxor and El Gouna was in a minibus so small that our luggage was tied to the roof - unacceptable for a 4 hour journey considering that transfers between the boat and temples were in far bigger buses.The final transfer between Three Corners hotel and Hurghada airport was booked incorrectly. The booking is for pick up at Fort Arabesque Spa and Villas, Makadi Bay. We would have been left at 0225 in the morning with limited means of getting to our return flight. We checked on checkmypickup.com and it showed error. Fortunately the excellent customer affairs staff at Three Corners rectified the problem with the transfer agent Masters Travel. However, although Mid Counties put the onus on us to check, it rather begs the question as to what a tour operator/travel agent is doing for their money?I emailed classic holidays on 28 February. To date I have received an automated acknowledgment only stating that replies are taking longer than usual. Well that's a month and still no answers - draw your own conclusions."", 'Nile Carnival Cruise - great experience.', 'For the first time I was able to experience the Nile Cruise from Luxor to Aswan.

The boat was nice, staff very friendly and the guide George very knowledgeable, who was very pleasant and engaged in a pleasant manner. The food was ok, we preferred buffet style. However, the itinerary was very busy, with early morning starts (5 am in Edna) of which we were not aware when we originally made a booking. In hindsight, we made a mistake of booking a room with veranda as there was not a lot of opportunity to enjoy it and while in dock we constantly had another boat moored alongside.', 'MS TIYI II Cruise - Stay away from this cruise', ""I traveled to Egypt with Exoticca in Mar/23. I booked the trip Nov/22 within advance to avoid problems. In short, we had a terrible experience on the trip due to several factors:Misleading advertising: For starters we bought a 5 star package with a superior category 4 star Nile cruise and they gave us a disgusting downgrade to this ship called MS TIYI II that doesn't deserve not even 1 star.Room: We asked for a room with a double sized bed, when arriving on the ship and in the hotel they gave us a room with two single beds.Filthy: The bed sheets were dirty, the room was disgusting. The bathroom and towels were unbelievably sickening. Not to mention that the pool was unusable due to stained and lack of maintenance.Inconvenience: One day after 10 p.m 2 boat operators entered our room without our consent to check something in the water pipes. My wife and I were sleeping and we were scared as someone was invading our room in the middle of the night. I couldn't even talk to them because they only spoke Arabic, we felt very angry and terrified.Plugs: The plugs were in a terrible state and we couldn't charge our phones or use the plugs at all.Pool Chairs: The mattresses on the deck chairs were so dirty that all passengers had to use a towel to sit on.People, if you value your money and well being, stay away from Exoticca and MS Tiyi II ship!"", 'Didn’t pay a penny!', 'Really enjoyed just sitting and seeing the boats and floukas in the river.

Abdul our waiter was genuine and a joy  to be served by while Abdul and his deputy along with the chefs kept on top of everything The cabin had everything but was tight and there were plenty of areas to relax especially the top deck. As other reviews note because of the ships docking alongside cabin and dining room curtains are often kept closed with no view of the river which one would expect on a cruise and is disappoonting . The encouragement of some guests of the boat traders with their constant screaming mars the full pleasure of cruisng down the Nile.', 'Dated depressing decor', ""We travelled on the presidential odessy , the boat itself was very dated and needs a full refurbishment, staff were lovely apart fron reception who were not very helpful. Alot of us came down with diarrhea, the cabins were small and depressing we couldn't open the curtains for the flies.

Food was very good all week and staff absolutely lovely, all very helpful.HOWEVER the system for paying for drinks is a scam, each time you order anything you have to sign a duplicate sheet with your name and cabin number. What should happen is that you are then given a copy so you can keep a record of what you have spent, however no-one was ever given a copy. When we came to pay our bill at the end of the week there were things on there we had not ordered, such as additional bottles of wine and beers. As we had no evidence we didn't have a leg to stand on and just had to pay.Also if you chose to pay in GBP, they gave an exchange rate of only 23 Egyptian pounds to the pound sterling when the bank rate was 36. I chose to pay on my card in Egyptian pounds but was than charged 4% extra, still better than being hammered with the ridiculous exchange rate.

The guides they provided for the excursions were knowledgeable and great fun. Well done  Hussan and Marco. Mena House was comfortable and had amazing views of the pyramids.

Having travelled for many years independently we were a little concerned as to how the process would work, from transfers, the boat, temple visits, eating times etc.We should not have worried. Everything worked like a well-oiled machine. Transfers were fine, boat accommodation was better than expected, cabins were comfortable and very clean. Food was plentiful with a good selection for all tastes.Trips were the highlight; we had 2 Egyptologist’s with us, who split us into 2 small groups. They were both very knowledgeable and had a really good command of English, and the groups small enough to allow everyone to hear the commentary and allow questions from all. The schedule is quite punishing however with many very early starts, but in our view a price well worth paying for all the sights on offer.The only slightly disappointing trip was the Philae light show, the light show itself needs updating.Overall an unbelievable experience and we would fully recommend Classic Holidays.', 'SS Sudan - Save your money', 'We were very much looking forward to our cruise on the SS Sudan, the early 20th century paddle wheeler where Agatha Christie wrote a portion of ""Death on the Nile"".  The boat is owned and operated by a French tour company, a fact not disclosed in the marketing materials directed at English speakers.  The Egyptian crew struggled with English.  The boat itself is nice enough and reasonably maintained.  However, the food is atrocious for a cruise priced at 800 Euro per person per day.  The same small Continental breakfast buffet was served each day.   The same soup was re-invented an re-cycled each day over a five day cruise.  The entrees ranged from mediocre to inedible.  Left overs were sometimes dressed up and re-served.  The internet, even in the lounge area, is virtually non-existent.  Don\'t plan on streaming anything while aboard, and you cannot rely on vessel\'s wi-fi for your phone service.  If you do succeed in accessing the internet, you will be randomly kicked off after a few minutes.  The general manager was absent from the vessel for the first four nights of the cruise, and it was obvious the crew took advantage of his absence by not attending to details such as lighting the candles in the common areas.  A nice touch was the flowers delivered on the first day of the cruise; however, they were already dead and were wilted by the third day.  The upper sun deck is lovely, but only has nine lounge chairs for a vessel that carries 40 plus passengers.  The same passengers staked out the chairs every day but the last.  The ship does have a bar as advertised, but it is not well-stocked.  Order a cocktail at your peril - it will be something very different from what you expect.  Complaints were either ignored or glossed over by supervisory personnel.  When I was finally able to speak to the general manager on the last day of the cruise, he acknowledged that he was aware of the issues with food and internet connectivity.  He gave me no indication that these issues were being addressed.The cruise was particularly disappointing because the land portions of our trip both before, after and while aboard SUDAN in Egypt were first class.  We had no complaints about our day trips from the boat and the guide provided while on the cruise.  Food quality and internet access were not issues at the hotels we stayed at before and after the cruise.  Most tellingly, the food in coach on Egypt Air and Turkish Air on the flight home.This could have been so much better with minimal effort and less corner cutting.', 'Adventure, Knowledge, Magic and Wonder', 'Feb 2023 and a wonderful Nile Cruise with Orbital on the Esadora. The boat is great value for money, staff are friendly and helpful, food was great, my vegan family members managed better than they thought and the cabins were clean and comfortable.

I did not compare this ship with others, but from what I heard, it is considered as one of  a good standards ships in Egypt (!!).The rooms are small and this is expected, the mattress is comfortable, it has tea & coffee set, we were not able to turn on the AC to heat (only cooling). Connected rooms are available.Three meals are included, not variable, not tasty but somewhat satisfactory. Water and drinks are not included, you have to pay for them.The pool at the deck is small, it was cold out there so we were not able to use it. The program included evening entertainment (2-3 shows), but this was not true, nothing was provided at the three evenings we spent on the ship.As we asked for the WIFI, the first answer was that it is not free, when we faced them with what they claimed on their website they provided us with complementary  1 GB WIFI during our stay, it was weak at the room but good at the restaurant and the lounge bar. Check out is at 8 am (too early) our guide was to pick us at 12 pm, they only allowed us to delay check out to 9 am.If there will be a next time I will look for another cruise ship even if it costs more.', 'No no no to MS Semiramis 111, go at your peril', ""MS Semiramis 111, nit 5* as I was sold, 3.5 according to Expedia.

Can’t wait to return when the GEM opens. If you can, take time to cruise down the Nile. It is worth every penny and minute. From Cairo to Luxor to Aswan, there is so much to see and it is so lovely to be on the river.

It was incredible to see in the Saints Sergius and Bacchus Church the cave where the Holy Family stayed for three months during the Flight to Egypt. The church, built in the 4th century when Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire, is beautiful with stunning icons. There is a lovely latticework through which you can enter the congregation.The Hanging Church is so named as it was built over a Roman fortress, which you can see as you approach the church. If I understand it correctly the Hanging Church is the seat of the Coptic Papacy, Churches have the same design as temples form of temples with the “holy of holies”/altar only available to the priest.  The altar is in a private room that is closed off and in front of the congregation. The priest’s words are broadcast to the congregation. Our guide being Copt provided special insight into the history and liturgy of the Copt faith and these specific churches. What is especially poignant are the parallels between the ancient Egyptian religion and Christianity. All we learned during visits to the ancient Egyptian temples, tombs and pyramids about rebirth, virgin birth, rebirth from an enclosed stone tomb, three gods; father, son and spirit; son of god in form of a man made the adoption of Christianity by Egyptians relatively easy. I had always thought that Christianity’s roots were in the Old Testament with the foretelling of Christ in the book is Isaiah. Now I see the deep roots and influence of the Ancient Egyptian religion on Christianity.If you have any interest in the history of Christianity, Coptic Cairo is a must see, An extra treat was walking by the Ben Ezra Synagogue at the site where baby Moses was retrieved from the Nile. Our appreciation for Copt Cairo was enhanced greatly by the explanations by our excellent guide Osama Petro.  I strongly urge visitors to do research in the Copt faith and/or go with a guide.

In 1517, the very last Mamluk sultan, Tumanbay, took refuge inside the mosque in an attempt to evade capture by the victorious Ottoman army as it took control of Cairo, resulting in the Ottomans bombarding the mosque with cannonballs from the Citadel.These demolition attempts, however, drew criticism from Cairo's population, which subsequently pressured authorities into repairing damages.It is challenging to figure out how this construction impressed the people after inauguration, back in 1363. It is also believed that limestone from the Pyramids of Giza was quarried for use in the mosque's construction. The mosque hosts four Islamic schools (madrassas) and accommodation for their students.There’s a shoes wardrobe at the entrance where the visitors can leave their shoes before visiting the mosque.

The original plan was for four minarets but only three were built and one of these subsequently collapsed reportedly killing several hundred people. Surprisingly the dome is made of wood.The doorway where you enter is immense but you then walk through some relatively dark and low-ceilinged corridors until you enter a large courtyard that is shaped as a cruciform with four separate areas for the different schools of thought that surround a domed ablutions fountain. The walls of the courtyard rise up several stories and hold the rooms for the teachers and students. The main prayer area is off to one side of this courtyard and behind that is the mausoleum.There is some very lovely different coloured marble in the prayer hall and some ornate woodwork in the mausoleum but overall we did not consider it to be as ornate as the more modern Al Rifai Mosque that is next door and which can be visited with the same ticket to the Sultan Hussan Mosque which cost EGP80 per person.Also there were only really two areas to visit here being the Courtyard which had the Prayer Room on one side and the mausoleum.Immense and historic but I would not consider it to be a must see if you have limited time in Cairo.', 'i lived by mosque', ""historic place , ancient mosque and it faced another legend el refaaa'e mosque . any one need more data could contact me"", 'Deserves a UNESCO', ""One of the world's largest mosques, building started in 1356.

Anderson decorated both the public and private areas of the home with an interesting array of art work, furniture, and sculptures.  As is typical of merchant homes of the period, the occupants are able to look out over the street through screened windows to monitor visitors to the house without being immediately seen.

The yard is surrounded by a covered colonnade, the part towards Mecca with three rows of columns. Actually, each of the hundred+ columns got a different decor carved into its capital.The Minaret is unique by its outside stairs giving it a strange look.The place isn't too much frequented by tourist groups so it is really a nice place to visit and maybe even have a rest in the shadow of a remote corner."", 'Very run down', 'It was a giant building with so much history.

Also out of respect, men had to wear long pants, and women had to wear clothing to cover their legs and shoulders and wear a scarf over their head.We climbed to the top of the Minaret at the Mosque of Ibn Tulun.

The mosque was built in 879 AD by Ahmed Ibn Tulun the founder of the Tulunid Empire of Egypt. The mosque was created out of mud bricks and occupies about 304,812 square feet of land. It comes third on this list of world’s largest mosques. It is also one of the most ancient mosques in Egypt which is still in its original shape after all the years. An enclosure surrounds the mosque from three sides and there are also little courtyards that are called ziyadas which were created for the purpose of providing privacy and to separate the sacred worshipping space from the world outside. These are bordered by tall archways and broad pillars that are decorated by elaborately carved motifs. The mosque’s minaret is a thing of beauty itself and features a spiral staircase and has three floors each of which are of different shapes.', 'An Early Gem of Islamic Architecture', 'The Mosque of ibn Tulun is vast, mysterious, and meditative.  Walking among its ancient colonnades and lamps is soothing and evocative of older days.', 'Beautiful and very old', 'The Mosque of Ibn Tulun was a particular treat on my tour of a number of mosques in Cairo. I visited during the low season for tourists, so I can\'t say how crowded it might get at other times; I was one of only three or four visitors in the mosque while I was there.The mosque was built in the ninth century and has survived a great deal of turmoil since then. It is not pristine or polished, but its simplicity is part of its elegance. The lattice windows are beautiful.The minaret is definitely worth a visit--enter from the ""moat"" inside the mosque\'s outer wall. Head around to your right when you walk in the main gate, and you\'ll find the entrance to the minaret there. Partway up the staircase splits, and you can go out onto the roof above the colonnade as well. The view from the roof and from further up in the top of the minaret gives you a sense of the scale of the site.The only reason I didn\'t give the mosque five stars is because the guards had a whole series of buckets that they shove in front of you for donations--for covering your shoes (to be expected), but also for other donations, and then they tell you that what you donate (e.g. 50£E) is not enough (""more! 100! 200!""). This is not required--the mosque is free to enter--but it creates an unnecessarily awkward dynamic when trying to enter a sacred space.', 'Stunning Mosque', 'This is a beautiful piece of architecture quite unlike other mosques I have seen. Don’t miss the Gaylord Anderson house next to it. It gives insights into the domestic architecture of old Cairo and the lifestyle of a British expat.', 'Not as reknown as it should be', ""Egypt was conquered by Arabs in 641, after a siege of the fortress of Babylon and the construction of the city Al-Fustat under it. Egypt thus remained an Arab province.The beginning of Egyptian semi-independance from the caliphs of Islam was due to the governor of Egypt, Ahmad Ibn Tulun, of Turkic origin. He ruled since 868. Not only, while nominally he recognised the rule of Abbasid caliphs in Damascus, he became de facto independant, but also conquered Great Syria (with Palestine) and Cilicia. His dinasty ruled Egypt until Abbasid reconquest in 905.Ibn Tulun created a new capital city of Egypt called Al-Qata'i' north of Al-Fustat and it was destroyed by the Abbasids, but the mosque was spared.It is a large mosque, notable for its minaret with spiral steps, which evoke the spiral minaret of the mosque of Samarra, then the capital of Ibn Tulun's overlords, the Abbasids.Apart from that, there are nicely decorated elements, such as the mihrab (the niche showing the direction of Mecca), although this is a copy, the original is in the Museum of Islamic Art in Cairo.The fountain in the middle of the courtyard is nice too. The architecture in general is a bit heavy, but looks nice in the evening sun.While the mosque of 'Amr Ibn al-'As, the conqueror of Egypt, which is located where Al-Fustat used to be, is in theory older, it changed its form so many times and it is not so beautiful overall, so I believe this mosque is much more interesting.The mosque is a bit apart from the proper Cairo old town as well as from the Christian Quarter and the Mosque of 'Amr Ibn al-'As. It is between them. Therefore, it is not so reknown or frequented, but it's worth a visit. I've been there twice.Around, there is Anderson museum, but I haven't been there, so I can't comment.However, close to it even is the tomb of Shagar ad-Durr. Not at all reknown person in the West, she deserves attention. She was a Kurdih or Turkic or Armenian slave (but most likely Turkic) and the wive of the Ayyubid sultan Salih Ayyub, who died when the crusaders of St Louis attacked Egypt. To save the country, she concealed her husband's death, forged his signatures and kept the state going until the crusaders were defeated, and the son of the ruler came from far away city of Hasankeyf (nowdays in Turkey). But this stepson was hostile towards her and towards the mamluks (slave-soldiers) who helped to get the crusaders defeated. So he was killed in an interesting fashion, and the mamluks chose a new ruler. They chose Shagar ad-Durr, a women, which was a major scandal, and the caliph of Baghdad allegedly said that if there are no men in Egypt, he can send some from iraq. Shagar ad-Durr was forced to abdicate, but she became the wife of one of the next rulers, Aybak. But when Aybak decided to marry another woman, a princess, Shagar got angry and killed her husband, which got her killed in result.Still, this unique Muslim woman ruler has a remaining tomb. Not very lavish, but quite nice. Sadly, however, the trash around it is not being cleaned, at least not when I was there."", 'Lots of history here!', 'Mosque was built starting 868 AD.

Even if you give the donation to one of the 2 is fine. Upon entering the mosque you will need to wear plastic over your shoes/sandals since it is a mosque. The mosque is not very clean and been maintained well and hence you can pray here but best to do wudu elsewhere since the wudu area is quite hidden.After a quick browse around you can visit the minaret from the other side of the building, entry is just below the minaret.Getting to the entrance of the mosque is a bit tricky and you may have to go around the mosque to see the police cars which is the entry gate to the mosque.', 'Magnificent Old Mosque', ""Considered one of the oldest and largest mosques in Cairo, I couldn't pass it up. It was quiet with very few people present; however, the history provided by our guide was impressive. This is essentially what remains of a 9th century city built by Ibn Tulun.

Plus the street is pedestrian so you dont have to worry about being run over for a nice change.', 'Revisiting Medieval Cairo at Al Muizz street ( must visit)', 'If you’re visiting Egypt for the first time know that Cairo is certainly not all about the Pyramids and the Sphinx.  The Pyramids of Giza are the last standing monument of the seven miracles of the ancient world. But Medieval Cairo will surprise you with equally mesmerizing archeological sites. Muizz Street is by far the most amazing place to visit the Islamic archeological sites that go back to when Cairo was first established as the capital of Egypt. Captivating mosques, Madrassah (religious schools), and  Sabils ( public supply for drinkable water) … the architecture is simply diverse and picturesque … the colors are still vibrant and the vibe is mystical. People are friendly, Khan Al Khalili is so near and a lot of good restaurants are situated around the street.', 'HEART OF OLD CAIRO', ""Al Muizz Street, in heart of Islamic Cairo, dates back to Cairo's foundation in 969AD and developed over centuries.

Also, there are shops and cafés on Al-Muizz street."", 'Enough with the aggressive guard behavior', 'The place is beautiful but the guards ruin the experience. At two of the buildings the guards do the scam where they block part of the building (which we bought a ticket to see) and then go through the charade of opening it for us, in hopes of getting a tip. They also aggressively push their guiding services. This annoying behavior of the guards has to stop.', 'Beautiful by night', 'Best seen at night, in my opinion, when kids walk by eating clouds of sticky cotton candy, when young men pose for photos in the purple and gold lights of the old buildings, when couples stroll together in the cool evening air, and old men play backgammon and smoke shisha in plastic chairs in front of tiny shops. The historical buildings are a living part of the city. The tourists are the minority after dark, and everything feels so alive.', 'The Heart of Islamic Cairo', 'The street is named for the first Fatimid Khalifa of Egypt – Muizz l’Din Allah (Strengthener of the Religion of God). The Fatimids—a North African Ismaili Shiah Dynasty--conquered Egypt in 969 AD and developed Cairo as their capital.This street ran through the then center of Cairo and later was a major thoroughfare through recent times.  The area around the street features in Naguib Mahfouz’s “Cairo Trilogy” set of novels.Caroline Williams’ “Islamic Monuments in Cairo: A Practical Guide” is quite useful in providing details on the buildings in this street as well as other Islamic sites in Cairo.  It includes detailed maps.  If you can read Arabic, Abbas Al Tarabili’s  ( عباس الطرابيلى )   book “ شوارع لها تاريخ "" has a lot of interesting information on this street as well as others in Cairo. He traces the development of Cairo neighborhood by neighborhood over the years.Because the street remained central to Cairo over the centuries, there are not only Fatimid buildings, but also those of successor regimes.  So a good mix of architectural styles.Mosques, madrassas (schools), bemaristans (hospitals), sabils (public water dispensaries), hamams (baths).You can buy a combination entrance ticket valid for entry to 10 sites  for LE 100 at the .Qawalun Complex.The street is also near other important sites, e.g. Azhar Mosque.  A short walk to Bab al Zuweila, Suk al Khaymiyya, If you walk to the end of the street Bab Al Futuh, you will notice a small green dome near the gate.  The Tomb of Hassan Thawq.  A southern Egyptian charged with resolving differences between the young men at the Bab Al Futuh.  Disappointed with his failure to achieve peace, he packed up his belongings and prepared to return home.  He dropped dead just before the gate and is buried in a small tomb on the right as you exit.  It is said that if two or more people in Cairo are fighting, the statement “Hassan Thawq has not left Cairo” will calm things down.  But only if said in Arabic.Over the centuries Egyptian armies exited to campaigns via the Bab al Futuh and returned through the Bab al Nasr (Gate of Victory) on the right as you exit Futuh.  There are portions of the Fatimid and Ayubid walls on the main street outside Futuh.Well worth a visit.', 'Pedestrian street showing 10th C architecture.', 'We took an Uber($3) for 4.2 km east to the entrance of this historic part of Old Cairo.

A lovely stroll and great for pics.', 'The main street of proper Cairo', 'While settlements close to it (Al-Fustat, Al-Qata\'i\', Al-\'Askar) were the capitals of Egypt since the Muslim conquest in 641, proper Cairo was founded only after the Shia caliphs Fatimids, ruling originally in the Maghreb, conquered Egypt in 969. The conqueror of Egypt was called Gawhar (A Jewel) and was sent by caliph Al-Mu\'izz, who soon moved to Cairo as his new capital. That\'s why this street bears his name. This caliph was also notable for his love of languages. He spoke Arabic, Persian, ""Roman"" (Greek? Latin?) and some black African language, as well as some Slavic probably. The street starts with Fatimid walls, with beautiful gates, and there are are many mosques and tombs in the street, the most notable being - the mosque of Fatimid caliph (996-1021) noted for his eccentric behaviour and persecution of Christians and, to a lesser extent, Jews. Renovated and nice, with strange minarets. The mosque was started by Al-Hakim\'s father, Al-\'Aziz. The minarets are massive, but the upper part is small and in a completely different shape, because they come, allegedly, from the time of the mamluk sultan Ladjin.- the later Fatimid mosque Al-Aqmar. Small but beautiful and interesting- the mosque of Qalawun, a mamluk sultan notable for conquering the crusader capital Tripoli in 1289 and preparing an expedition which, lead by his son after his death, captured the capital of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, Acre and the rest of the crusader posessions in Great Syria, apart from Arwad and Cilicia. Strangely, while Qalawun thus defeated the crusaders, his mosque (with medresa and hospital) bears a gothic influence. Do enter inside. I didn\'t want to do it in 2013-4 because I found the 100x difference between what Egyptians and what foreigners have to pay for entrance apalling. But well, this ticket gives you entrance to some other monuments in this street, and the Qalawun complex is beautiful inside and worth a visit. I visited it in 2018 and was pleased with it.

National Museum of Egyptian Civilization NEMC,History Museums,4.5,"Al Fustat Street Ain Al Sira, Cairo 17611 Egypt","This is a new museum, thoughtfully arranged chronologically to give one a good understanding of Egypt’s history. See the upper level first — it goes through 4000 years of Egyptian history — then proceed down to the mummies display (which is fascinating). Otherwise one emerges from the mummies at a rather random location on the upper level — and it’s confusing to figure out where to start. Go here before the Egyptian Museum because it provides a better explanation of Egyptian history. Once you have that basic background, the Egyptian Museum — which is somewhat disorganized — makes a bit more sense. Fridays  extended hours 6-9 pm, less busy than normal.","['This museum has all the royal mummies', 'The architecture was beautiful.

There seems to be no concept other than showing off a number of exceptionally lovely pieces. The mummies in the basement are a bit better presented.

The royal mummies obviously being the highlight and single handedly making the visit worthwhile.The BIG PROBLEM was that when I bought my ticket at the outside sales kiosk, the person tried to scam me by telling me the tickets were EGP400 each instead of EGP240.  Having saw on someone else’s TripAdvisor review that also said tickets were EGP400 (that guy must’ve fell for the same scam!), I  begrudgingly paid the extortionate amount.  Only after walking into the museum and seeing the main sales kiosk with prices displayed did I realize I was duped.  I explained to the staff at the main kiosk, who were helpful and we all marched back to the smaller office where I confronted the scammer.  Realizing the jig was up (they have CCTV cameras at least in case evidence was required), he refunded me the difference.  To the museums credit they did have someone from the PR department come to me to ask about this incident afterwards (and the only reason this wasn’t a 1 star review), but honestly for one of the premier museums in Egypt to have staff trying to scam people is outrageous.  I hope they do a proper investigation with the appropriate punishment for that staff member.', 'Excellent must see museum in Cairo', 'This is simply a fantastic museum and a must on any visit to Cairo.  The mummy exhibit was incredible!  The 22 mummies are placed in order of when the pharaoh ruled Egypt and their relationship to one another.

We appreciated that there were signs and descriptions for the majority of the museum.There is a gift shop and cafe that sell a good range of items at a fair price.

Both mosques were well worth visiting.We then proceeded to the Gayer Anderson Museum - a very unique experience. Two houses (I believe from the 17th century) occupied by a British major in the 30s and 40s. He collected all sorts of antiques.

The history of Islamic Egypt is well documented as you walk round the rooms. It’s light and airy now, but like anywhere in the height of summer it’s going to be hot.I always recommend this museum to visitors to Egypt, the Islamic history is overshadowed by the pharaonic history but is equally important and intriguing.My only gripe is tour groups who feel that they take precedence in viewing rooms, and their guides who shout so you can’t concentrate, which means you have to rush ahead or dodge them.', 'Splendors of the past', ""Well curated and organized museum, hosted in an impressive palace. Splendid artifacts crafted during the time of Umayyad, Fatimid, Ayyubid, Mamluk and Ottoman rulers of Egypt are on display. The exhibition include ceramics, fabrics, carpets, ivory, woodcrafts, swords, guns, warrior armoires and helmets and even maritime instruments. By visiting this museum, one can make an idea about the rich Islamic history of Egypt. Descriptions available in both English and Arabic.

There are calligraphy, ceramic, glass, metal, wood and textiles on display.

Entrance fee for a student at the time was 50£, and they do have a bag check. The additional charge for take photos is also worth doing, AND they do rigorously check to make you paid the photo fee. The museum takes about 1-2 hours, and is full of beautiful rugs, coins, door ways and furniture. Most information is in arabic, so its easy to justify the visit for the non-reader museum types.

The objects are outstanding and the organization of the displays is excellent.  The object labels were informative & in English which was a bonus.  We learnt a lot about Egypt after 600 CE.  This Museum should be on the itinerary of more visitors to Cairo.', 'Great place to learn something new', 'Went to the museum when I had some down time between monuments. It is nothing like I expected. The museum if full of great art and artifacts. It explains some of the history of Islam and other religions in the region.

The streets were teeming with people out to celebrate the Prophet's birthday and the Qasr el Nil Bridge, flanked by lions, was reminiscent of the Charles Bridge in Prague on New Year's Eve. We spotted the Cairo Tower - you can hardly miss it, it's the tallest structure in Cairo - and decided to visit. It looks modern. Somebody thought maybe early 21st century. It came as a big surprise to find that it opened in 1961. Its top is meant to represent a lotus flower. Most people buy tickets to ride to the top and look at the view. We may do this next time. Instead we went into the courtyard. I bought a souvenir at the gift shop, which actually has a few items you can't buy in every other shop. There's a coffee shop too. On this particular night Mustapha invited visitors to have pictures taken with his very good-looking camel and ride it too. Is he there every night? Probably not. But if you find him be sure to say hello. He's a very friendly guy. I suggested al fresco dining in the restaurant, where there was a nice breeze blowing. On the TV was a football match actually taking place in the stadium next door. There is lots of real foliage and it's all very charming. We had Stella beers. On the menu are snacks like chips, Croque Monsieur and Croque Madam. Mustapha came past, giving someone a ride on his camel, and we bought him a beer.

Same on the way down - huge wait times and no apparent order, with some people able to go to down straight away and others waiting 40+ minutes before being told to enter the elevator.

Good views including the Nile & Pyramids, but Citadel views are better in my opinion and there is  a lot more to see and do there. We went in the daytime, so cant comment on the night experience.

They try to sell you more expensive tickets to jump the queues to get up and down, but if you buy the dinner ticket you get priority access anyway, so be careful on that. The views of the Nile and the traffic and the neon lights are great at night as this way you don’t see the amount rubble and building works going on around the city that are clearly visible during the day!

The Tower is illuminated in each night in various colors and looks truly splendid from all over Cairo It also has a revolving restaurant and you can order snacks. Many tables are all around The observation deck is equipped with many telescopes offering incomparable views over Cairo and its surrounding area. We could easily locate the Saladin Citadel, the Pyramids of Giza as well as Saqqara. Many other sites, including a mosque or church etc .

The lower floor features a cafe with a decent size menu of tasty treats as well as a few beers. I paid for the priority queue and 150 EP food option. I realised it wasn’t busy so should not have done that. But assuming you need the food voucher to eat up there I was glad it did that ticket as I enjoyed a relaxing tasty meal. Prices fair for the location and food. Staff were great and did well considering how busy it was. Great views, stands out on the skyline. Easy to get to.

Very few drinks were actually available. There was a few of us so there was a set menu but allergies were ignored and the food (a chicken dish) seems to have the approach pile it high on the plate and all will be ok.

And yes, while on the deck, I was approached by a gentleman in an ancient pharaoh-like costume from whom I bought my ""fortune sheet"" or such (on some kind of parchment paper with also my name written in ancient Egyptian characters).And nearby, actually located at like right across one of the two arms of the Nile from this tower (about a 25-minute walk by crossing the River on a nice bridge with ""lion sculptures"" at both ends) is the Egyptian Museum with really ""plenty of"" miscellaneous antiquity items including sizeable sculptures & decorative mummy coffins.', 'GREAT VIEW BUT OVERPRICED', ""Great panoramic view.

On Thursday (the planned delivery day), we have waited until 16:00 clock and no delivery, until we contacted IKEA via the chat option on IKEA.eg and informed the central delivery station. An unidentified car park in front of my home and three persons wearing normal cloths (Usually, they come with IKEA official wearing) bought and assembled the box. They have tried several time and failed. Again contacted IKEA chat, nothing happen. We refused to accept the box and did not sign the delivery notice (this was a wise decission). After several complaints, I have finally received a phone call with the customer service, who was convincing me to take the cabinet as it is with the defect (what a shame!). He also informed me that IKEA has an agreement with a subcontractor, who did this mistake. I told him it is none of my business, I ordered the stuff from IKEA, not a subcontractor. Thanks for the online Egyptian law, I told him come take your stuff as per online purchase law. Finally, they came and pick up the cabinet. Now started the session two of the story, when I bought the cabinet, they have charged my master card on the same moment. When it comes to refund, I never heard from them so far, It is almost one week. I send several Email and contacted IKEA via the chat option, every time, we will contact you within 48 hours, within one day and almost a week and nothing. No confirmation of a refund. As the story has no end, I have contacted my bank to take an action with them. Usually, IKEA is a very good store with a great service, but this time was horrible.

Enjoy the journey', 'Unique document of urban planning in pre-modern Cairo', ""Other reviewers have talked about the tents that are manufactured in this covered street (and in nearby ones), focusing on the qualities of these craft products.I wouldn't want to repeat what has already been written by them, but I would like to draw attention to the architecture of this street, which in my opinion is equally worthy of note.This street, located just south of the Bab Zuweila gate, as I understand is also known as Qasaba of Radwan Bey, named after the Bey (governor) who, in addition to having organized the street, redeveloped the entire neighborhood around the middle of XVIIth century. The meaning of the operation was to extend towards the southern part of the historic city the character of a high-level commercial area that originally (at the time of the Fatimid dynasty, X-XII centuries) was proper to the city inside Bab Zuweila gate.The street is the only surviving covered street in Cairo, which shows almost intact the features with which it was built: two long and tall parallel buildings delimit it: both buildings have a strongly protruding foreground (as they rest on mighty shelves) compared to the ground floor, so that on the first floor the two buildings are very close together. The intention to maximize the useful surface of the buildings , while preserving the width of the street level, is very clear: it is the same process that, in other medieval and early modern cities in the world, has led to the formation of urban porticoes (Bologna, Italy, is probably the best known example). Finally, at the top of the two buildings, the roofs are further protruding, until they join together.This original architecture (object of careful restoration about 15 years ago) recreates, like few others, the atmosphere of early modern Cairo, giving today also a prestigious frame to the trades that take place inside."", 'Well worth finding', 'I love visiting the street markets of Cairo - and none is more impressive than the “street of tent makers” - it is fantastic.

Lots of markets adjoining it, and it makes a nice afternoon to walk through.---Getting here, we walked down the street from Khan El-Khalili, and on the way there we stopped for a delicious fuul sandwich at a stall on the corner (it's on the corner of Al Motaz Ldin Allah and Haret Al Fahamin). It was 5EGP for 2 sandwiches; you could easily order 6 or more, as each sandwich is just a half a pita bread filled with fuul, served with a hot chilli pepper. This is truly delicious egyptian food. So simple, and tasty. We continued to walk down, where we saw the first stall of a quilter, 'Hany'. He was extremely friendly, and had a wide variety of quilts (some made by him, and others not). We purchased a quilt from him as we appreciated the lack of pushy sales and the price was well within our budget (we did not bother to haggle, though I'm sure that was a surprise for him). Continuing on, we saw a falafel stand manned by some younger children. Again, stopped for a falafel sandwich here for 5EGP. Again, delicious. The egyptian falafels (ta'amiya) are very fluffy, and spiced with coriander and fennel seeds. The Tentmakers Alley is quite short -- and the quilts are similar between the different stalls. Explore for a bit and find the ones that you like best. Afterwards, we continued on down a dusty and busy market filled with produce, fish and We were about to do a food tour (with food bellies, highly recommended) so we held out, but there were 3 or 4 more stalls with delicious looking food that were doing brisk business. Would have liked to stop in and eaten some more delicious food. We continued on walking down towards the mosque of Mohammed Ali, and walked around the neighbourhoods there -- not a place most tourists venture, and it was definitely getting to the point of being 'slums' -- but the people were friendly (though they could not speak English), though definitely amused to see tourists in their area. Would be a nice area to tour with someone who knows it, as there are many workshops there and I'm sure some are making things that would be interesting for tourists (though we only saw carpenters and people working on car parts as we wandered the streets)."", 'Colorful printed fabrics', ""This covered market was built in the late 1600's by a man who was in charge of the annual pilgrimage to Mecca.

Also, for bargain hunters, the prices are cheaper for the beautiful fabric hangings than they are in the Khan/hotel souvenir shops.

And all in an amazing old covered market."", ""Lovely Bag Shop in Tentmaker's Bazaar"", ""I wandered into the Tentmaker's Bazaar to find a shop mentioned in 'The Rough Guide' that makes bags from colorful tentmaker's fabric.  There was no one at the shop when I arrived, but soon an elderly gentleman named Mokhtar Hamed came over to show me a few bags on display.  I liked one in particular, and I asked if he could adjust its handle to make it a big longer.  I also asked if he could make a few more bags for me.  He showed me the fabric that he had available and said the bags could be ready within a few hours.  Although I tried to bargain a little on the price, he wouldn't budge and laughingly told me that if I could find anyone else who did the same work, he would give the bags to me for free.  He is in fact the only shopkeeper in the bazaar who makes these beautiful bags and his prices are more than fair.  I watched him work at his sewing machine for a while and we chatted about life in Egypt and his family.  Then I went to explore more of Khan El-Khalil.  When I came back three hours later, all the bags were finished and I was thrilled to have such unique gifts to bring home.  If you get a chance to visit Islamic Cairo, I highly recommend that you stop by Mokhtar's shop.  He is a charming, grandfatherly man who is very talented.  His shop is called 'El Sayd Saleh Ragab' and it's on the left side of the Tentmaker's Bazaar toward the end of the covered passag.  It's small and unassuming, but there is a sign with its name to help you find the place.  Happy shopping:)"", 'Facinating', 'This street is an interesting trip into local life in Cairo.

My partner and I attended because we were looking for something off the beaten track that would give us more cultural insight into Egypt.We originally thought the show might be a bit kitschy or touristy.  We were completely wrong—nothing about this is geared towards Western tourists.  There’s no intro, no explanation, no program—they just launch straight into the performance.  My main feedback is that it’s just pretty long. An hour and 45 minutes is a LOT of whirling.  And it’s pretty loud as well.  It’s definitely low key though so if you wanted it’d be easy to leave early.  Also, there is a bathroom, with attendant working for tips. Not the nicest, but functional.  Show up around 6:30 for seats at the front — you buy tickets in a huge mad rush, then you have to wait til the performance starts.  We thought we’d leave and wander the souk while we waited, but they won’t let you back in.

I promise you will not regret!!!"", 'The whirling sufi show', 'The main dancer in this show was unbelievable. He danced around, whirling on the spot for over 20 minutes!

It is only offered on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays, starting at (or around) 7pm -- it does require a ticket (sold at the venue starting at 6pm) and the struggle to get a ticket is real! People line up early and fight their way to the front -- let's just say that the attendants at the venue could be more helpful. At the present time, the actual venue of the Wekalet Ghouri Arts Center is under renovation - the show takes place in a nearby building. My understanding is that it's a tad smaller -- the seats are pretty much up against the stage, which may be a bit too loud for young kids (have you heard a mizmar play up close? probably not -- and there is a reason for that...) so consider soft earplugs for the wee ones if you plan on sitting up close. Finally you will emerge, somewhat stunned, at the entrance of the Khan al Khalili, just past 9pm -- that's a very, very busy time, in a very, very busy place. Would be helpful to have thought through the transportation logistics, in advance. Very much worthwhile -- requires some advanced planning."", 'Oh my god', 'Just cross the road from the Bazar Khan al Kalili, taking the underground passage.

Literally people were pushing each other like animals to get inside through a narrow space between two doors.  My husband was able to squeeze through and ask for 3 tickets but they demanded to see the three persons. I had asked my mother to wait outside as I was afraid she would fall going down the stairs with all the people there pushing each other.

The original center was built in 1504 A. D by sultan Qunsuwah El Ghouri.

Luckily our guide knew the manager so we were given front row seats.

On the other side, the madrassa seems less ornate (possibly much-reconstructed after being ruined), but the main prayer area has a beautiful mihrab with glass and gold mosaic, plus more stucco and coloured glass windows up along the walls.When I visited in 2012 you were able to visit the remains of the maristan (hospital) at the back of the site, but this time it was closed; which is a pity, because even though what remains is less substantial, it still gave you an idea of what the overall complex was like. There was also a lovely restored fountain and stucco-carved window in that section.The interior of this complex is visited on the same ticket as seven other monuments along this street. (Ticket is 100 Egyptian pounds for a regular adult, I think; maybe more.) I suspect a lot of people wonder whether the ticket is worth the price; it is! Even if you only visit a few of the monuments (easy to do in an hour or two, depending on how long you like to pause to take pictures, etc), it's worth it. (And the upside of an official ticket is that you also don't need to contend with demands for baksheesh!)"", 'Gothic-influenced, nice inside', ""Qalawun was one of early, major mamluk sultans. He captured crusaders' Tripoli in 1289 and prepared an expedition against the main crusaders' capital, Acre, which was completed after his death by his son Al-Ashraf Khalil in 1291. This was the end of crusaders' states, although they did hang on in Arwad island until 1302, and Armenian Cilicia, associated with them, lasted much longer, as well as Cyprus and Aegean islands.While Qalawun destroyed crusaders, his mosque, with a school and an hospital, has some gothic influences.You may be surprised with relatively high price for entry, especially since it's so much higher for foreigners than for Egyptians. I didn't visit the mosque originally for that very reason. But it's worth it. The ticket is valid for other places along the Al-Mu'izz street too. The interiors of the mosque are quite impressive and beautiful."", 'Impressive', ""Built in the 13th century part of the exterior of this vast complex can be seen from the historic Muizz street as you walk by.  We didn't enter on this occasion but lovely detail within the stonework."", 'Took My Breath Away!', ""Built around 1284, this complex has been a hospital, the Sultan's burial dome, a madrasa and a place for prayers with one of the highest minarets in Egypt. Though there were 24 madrasas in the 11th  century, this is one of only two that are still here today.The mammoth scope of the wonderful architecture book my breath away! Definitely worth a visit, it only takes 30 minutes or so to go through quickly. This was included in a Mara House 9-day group tour (HIGHLY recommended!) with 16 others."", 'Very nice complex', 'This is a nice view of some of the construction done during the Mamluk period of Cairo. The mausoleum is incredibly impressive on the other sites also show consistent decoration but individual features all of which are beautiful.', 'Qalawoon mosque was stunning!', ""first of all, you should start at Qalawoon Mosque from the Al Azhar entrance side because you'll need to buy a ticket to enter all mosques along Moez street, it costs 100LE for foreigners and 5LE for Egyptians, and it will get you into seven sites in total. Qalawoon is frankly stunning, a gorgeous, well lit mosque with stained glass windows, mashrabeya, and a holy shrine in the centre of the room. The site has guides that you'll need to tip at least 50LE and if you ask very nicely and you're a small group, they'll take you to the rooftop and let you climb up the minarets for such a stunning view! Next door is Barqooq Mosque, which has gorgeous ceilings and wood cuts. Definitely worth the visit and a lovely, cool alternative to being out in the sun on a hot day."", 'A nice attraction', 'Qalawun brought the Golden Age for the Mamluks and founded a dynasty that endured on the throne for a whole century.His edifice speaks for itself.', 'Qalawun is an Islamic Arts and Architecture complex filled with rich culture and creativity.', ""The Qalawun complex includes a madrasa, a hospital and a mausoleum.  It resides in the Muizz area in the heart of Cairo and has been a center for important religious ceremonies and rituals of the Islamic faith for years.  It was buiit by the Sultan Al-Nasir Muhammad Ibn Qalawun in the 1280's who turned it into a hospital for all citizens and was later called the Miracle Hospital."", 'The First Attraction in Muizz street', ""There is no way you can miss this mosque if you are in Muizz Area.

Cairo Opera House,Theaters,4.0,"Opera Square, Zamalek, Cairo 11511 Egypt","This cultural venue, The National Cultural Centre ""Cairo Opera House"" is part of the Ministry of Culture and serves as an umbrella organization for all the music or dance companies, galleries, museums and the educational programs of the Cairo Opera House. It was established in 1988 with the inauguration of the new Cairo Opera House. Its goal is to promote the arts of music and dance and to preserve and renew traditional Arab music. In order to be more than just a place where music and art are performed the National Cultural Centre wants to give space to learning and inspiration, to the exchange of ideas, the respect of a common cultural heritage, and a shared passion for the arts. It encourages interest for music and art in the younger generation by offering ballet, voice or instrumental classes for talented children or youths. Performances of ballet, operatic or symphonic works are staged with Egyptian companies or in cooperation with foreign ensembles or soloists. Seminars and cultural conferences covering a wide range of artistic and intellectual issues are held regularly. Opera House companies are frequently sent on tours to different Egyptian governorates to give the people in urban areas the chance to see national and international art performances. In March 1985, Former President Mubarak laid the first corner stone of the new Cairo Opera House which was to be built with the support of JICA, the Japan International Cooperation Agency. Careful planning by the Ministry of Culture in Cairo and the JICA produced a design suggestive of traditional Islamic architecture and blending in harmoniously with the surrounding buildings. In October 1988,Former President Mubarak and His Highness, Prince Tomohito of Mikasa, the younger brother of the Japanese Emperor, inaugurated the National Cultural Centre “Cairo Opera House” in a remarkable ceremony. It was the first time for Japan to stage a Kabuki show, a traditional popular drama with singing and dancing, in Africa or the Arab World.","['Cairo Opera House', 'If you appreciate classical music, opera, ballet, or theater performances then, you are more likely to have a great time in The Opera.

There was no penalty for mobiles ringing loudly and calls actually taken as the music played.Beyond the absence of any management of the audience as befits a venue such as this, I would add that the Opera House is looking shabby now, in real need of refurbishment. Further, there is no schedule of events beyond September, the September calendar is in Arabic only, and I found no one who could speak English well enough to provide any information.

Originally ruling a state from Morocco to the borders of China, they were gradually reduced, until in 1258 Mongols captured Baghdad and killed the calips. But Mamluk sultan Baybars established a new line of Abbasids, reigning as mamluk puppets, in Cairo. Which is ironic, as the city was origally built by Fatimids, Shia anti-caliphs.There is also a tomb of famous jurist Ash-Shafi'i.Most of all, however, this necropolis is known as being used by poor people for habitation.

Barsbey has a grasping and impatient custodian who will whinge that you didn\'t give him enough baksheesh, but the other two complexes are easier to visit. All three are on a main street - you\'ll need to find your way in from the bus stop on Salah Salem street, but it\'s not too hard, and all the old ladies and local chaps will help show you the way, with hand gestures if you don\'t speak Arabic. You need to be ""relatively brave"" - happy navigating with a map and in an area where there are few tourists.

So the other inhabitants (mostly squatters as well, without any ownership card) fear that the same could soon happen to them. They are therefore suspicious of visitors, because they fear these may be government\'s or developers\' agents.As for us instead, we have crisscrossed the area for almost a whole day, without appreciable problems. Moreover, our influential friends have obtained for us the opening of tombs that are usually not open to visitors; like that of Princess Shivakiar (1876-1947; she was the first wife of Fu\'ad I, the first king of Egypt); or that of a great contractor of King Faruk era (whose name I cannot remember).We have also walked some streets lined with tombs that have now been transformed into dwellings or workshops.

Partly of Sunnis, whose leaders were officially cursed etc, and which lead to a Sunni uprising in Barwa. Of Jews, but that was a moderate persecution, and mostly of Christians, and that included confiscating all the church properties and an order to destroy all the churches and monasteries in his vast realm. Not to mention other orders. Mass conversions to Islam occured in result. At the end of his life, he changed his attitude towards Christians and allowed them to return to their previous religion and gave them back some of their churches and properties, albeit looted.He was declared manifestation of divinity by some of his followers, and they, under the name of druzes, still exist in Lebanon (f.e. Shuf mountains), Syria (Hawran / Gabal ad-Duruz plateau), and some villages in Israel.He was very eccentric and stubborn, and issued a lot of strange orders. F.e. he forbade women from going outside, and, to achieve that, he even forbade producing women shoes. He forbade drinking wine, and destroyed anything that could be used to producing it (honey, raisins, even threatening to destroy wheat granaries). Etc. There are many anecdotes of his reign. He was killing people for even minor actions, and sometimes without an apparent reason. Still, he was quite popular among much of population.He died in strange circumstances, as he used to have long night travels on his donkey, and once he just didn't return. Etc.The mosque is as it was built apart from the upper part of the minarets, which were allegedly built by mamluk sultan Ladjin. Ladjin was mostly known for reorganising the finances of Egypt, which included reasigning the land. One person, after he received a new land grant, discovered that is was greatly smaller than his previous one. He came to the sultan asking if there's some kind of mistake. The sultan replied: no, the mistake was made the last time.In later times, famous Egyptian historian and economist, Al-Maqrizi, author of a big description of medieval Cairo, was the imam of this mosque.The mosque is nicely restored by the Bohras, one of the offshoots of Isma'ili Shiism, with its leaders claiming descent from Fatimids, Al-Hakim included.

I also know the large Roman mosaic of Palestrina (Italy), depicting the Nile and where a beautiful well-shaped Nilometer is also clearly visible. Finally, on a previous trip, I visited the Nilometers in Elephantine and in Kom Ombo.This one in Rodah (according to the chronicles, built in 715 and rebuilt in 861 AD) is certainly the most beautiful and elaborate among the Nilometers I have seen, and is a ""not to be missed"", even with all the wonders that there are to see in Cairo and its surroundings .After the trip, however, I got the curiosity to understand if and how this medieval Nilometer had on-site ancestors in the Pharaonic era (which is often understood); and if there is evidence of this.So I came across the highly documented article by Étienne Drioton (former curator of the Egyptian section at the Louvre museum), ""Les origines pharaoniques du Nilomètre de Rodah"" (1952).From this writing it\'s clear that actually a Nilometer located in the nearby area should be the oldest in Egypt (it would even date back to the predynastic era, ie before 3100 BC). But it\'s important to know that it - according to the religious texts examined by Drioton - was not located here in Rodah (where after all the diggings carried out didn\'t reveal such ancient remains), but in Per-Hâpi; location to be identified with Helwan, 20 km further south.It\'s evocative to imagine the Pharaoh who, having heard from his officials of the arrival of the flood, lays his hands on the river intimating ""get up, Nile"", thus arousing amazement and reverence in his subjects.

Her mosque was set up shortly after her arrival to Egypt on the appearance of the new crescent moon of Shaaban (the eighth month of the Hegira calendar) in the year 61 A.H (AD 680 - 681). When she first arrived to the small village of Al Abassah of Al Sharkia governorate, east of Delta the Umayyad waly (governor) of Egypt Maslama Ibn Makhlid Al Ansary had been on the head of the gathering of well-wishers. She later settled down at Al Fustat city (first Islamic Capital of Egypt) where she became the guest of Maslama.After less than a year of her arrival to Egypt she passed away on the evening of 14th of Ragab (7th month of the Islamic calendar) 62 A.H. According to her will she was buried in the same place where she had lived for about eleven months. Her mausoleum was built close to the northern flank of Maslama residence, overlooking the River Nile bay near Al Sayeda Zeinab square. In the course of time Moslama\'s residence and the adjacent buildings crumbled away, with the exception of the mausoleum, which remained intact due to continuous repairs by princes, higher-ranking officials and religious leaders. The mausoleum was orated by domes, niches, and inscriptions of Arabic calligraphy. The first actual innovations of the mosque took place during the reign of Sultan Ahmed Ibn Tulun.he two Fatimid Sultans Al Mo\'ez Ledin Allah and Al Hakim Biamr Allah Allotted land endowments for the preservation of the mosque. In the sixth century after the Hijra, Sultan Al Adel Ibn Ayoub repaired the mosque and built a smaller mosque adjacent to it. The Mameluke Prince Abdul Rahman Katakhda reconstructed the mosque and furnished it with a toilet for ablutions. In 1201 A.H. the mausoleum was repaired and glided with a layer of yellow copper and the mosque area was expanded to cover three thousand square meters. In 1315 A.H. during the reign of Khedive Tawfik, the then ruler of Egypt, the present mosque was re-built adjacent to the mausoleum. In 1946 A.D King Farouk, the last monarch in Mohamed Ali\'s dynasty, ordered that both the mosque and the mausoleum be repaired. After the 23rd July revolution and during the era of President Gamal Abdul Nasser the mosque was expanded to cover an area of 4000 meters. The mosque was again expanded during President Hosni Mubarak terms of office to cover 18000meter with a capacity of 15000 worshippers, this expansion and the repairs subsequent to it were executed in line with the architectural styles and designs, implemented during Khedive Tawfik\'s era.The main facade of the present Mosque looks over Al Sayeda square with three gateways leading directly to the mosque. In the western facade there is a special gate for women leading to the Mausoleum. The minaret stands high to the left of this section.

The fortress is the city's oldest original structure and where some of the oldest coptic churches were built around its walls.According to history, Babylon is the name of the capital of Egypt's neighboring country -- I was thinkin' bout Babylon in Iraq, I may be wrong, as the first fort was built by the Persians (present day Iran). I dunno really. Due to water difficulty, the fort was relocated byt the then roman emperor Trajan at its present location which used to be only beside the Nile river.  It serves as the boundary between the lower and middle EgyptThe fortress is still impressive today, though at first sight I thought it was just an ordinary abandoned building of sort, until I've found out the story, and like in a film, the structure slowly developed into full colour on me.Go there during the early afternoon until just before the sun set, the whole area has this rustic feeling -- sumthin' bout the sun streaks on the old structures...really.  You can easily include it with all the sights around Coptic Cairo if you decide to come there before noon.Take the Metro Line that goes to Helwan and get off at Mar Girgis Station, the fort is the first sight in front of you.""]",30.0053458,31.2326938

We have wonderful photos to remember our experience that he took!', 'Best day trip to Cairo', ""I found Mostafas sunrise camel tour when looking for day trips to Cairo. After reading the reviews I knew this was the only pyramid camel tour I wanted to do on my day trip to Cairo. We spent ages trying to see how we could incorporate it into an existing day trip with a visit to the museum. As two young woman travelling with a child we were unhappy to travel around Cairo ourselves so decided to contact Mostafa to see if he could organise something for us. From the moment we got in touch with him he was wonderful. So kind and very accommodating. He organised a driver that picked us up at the airport and stayed with us during the day. We met Mostafa and went for the camel ride to see the pyramids at sunrise. Unfortunately, it was misty, so we didn't get to see them at this point, but that didn't detract from the day. We had been on a different Camel ride earlier in the week and after this I had been concerned about spending so much time on a Camel, however Mostafa's Camels are very well-loved and looked after. Mickey and Casenova are Mostafa's priority and I would urge anyone looking at booking a camel ride to book with Mustafa (or another operator with high welfare standards). My 5 year old son was also very weary of the Camels after our previous experience and asked if he could walk with Mostafa instead, again he was so reassuring and kind to my son, holding his hand whilst guiding the Camels. After the sunrise ride we met Mostafa at the pyramids and got some lovely photos and had a horse ride from a friend of his. My 5 year old was very taken with Mostafa and the photos he took, loving the ideas Mostafa had. We then took the long ride up on Mickey and Casenova to a beautiful restaurant in which Mostafa had made a reservation for us, overlooking the 9 pyramids. My son was completely reassured at this point and managed the whole trip, feeling very secure riding Casenova. Breakfast was some of the best food we had in Egypt. We then went to the Sphinx with Mostafa. Then onto the museum with the driver. We also felt very comfortable and safe with Nabil. All round we had a fantastic day thanks to Mostafa. You are a wonderful person Mostafa, thank you! We are so glad to have met you and call you a friend."", 'Beautiful and calm tour with the camels - perfect', 'The camels, Casanova, Mickey Mouse and Adam were so beautiful and well looked after. Mostafa and Abdl were great and treated the camels really well.Mostafa is a very professional tour guide, he arranged transport for us from our accommodation to meet him at the pyramids, which was very smooth and best to arrange through WhatsApp. You have to pay the entrance fee and fee for the car to go inside, this is not included with the camel tour. Once inside we met Mostafa, he offered us really nice tea and then spoke to us about the pyramids and gave us some interesting and balanced information. His manner is so relaxed and professional, we felt really at ease in his company and it was nice to be with a guide that doesnt overload you with information and gave you plenty of space to ask questions.Once on the camels we just enjoyed the scenery, had some nice photo moments, but overall it was just very relaxing and beautiful experience to ride the camels. The camel Adam gave my partner a kiss! Once we returned to the entrance and left the camels, Mostafa left us to go and have another look at the Syphinx in our own time and was also happy to help us if we wanted to buy anything in the market to make sure we got a good price. He waited with us until the car returned to pick us up.Throughout the tour he was professional, genuine and very calm. Abdl his cousin who came with the third camel, Adam, was so lovely as well and we really enjoyed our time with them so much.My partner proposed to me on this trip and Mostafa and Abdl helped him to make it a surprise and do it in the best moment of the tour, it was so special and they helped make it that way with their presence and support.Thank you so much Mostafa and Abdl and the camels, forever grateful 🙏🐫', 'MOSTAFA & HIS TRIP IS A MUST DO IN CAIRO FOR THE PYRAMIDS & SPHINX!!

I even got a kiss from Casanova at sunrise.Mostafa let me ride Mikey myself too.Breakfast at the Pyramid lounge was absolutely beautiful with the panoramic view of the Pyramids.Mostafa was very kind and organised a driver for us all day.. Nabil who was very kind & attentive too (picked us up from the airport.. drove us around Cairo and dropped us back off at the airport). At the Sphinx you get hassled but with Mostafa there was no hassling and very good prices were offered if we did want anything because he was with us.The whole day was done with ease and no worry because we booked with Mostafa. He even gave us a shot on his friends horses at the pyramids as a surprise for us. He is a fantastic photographer too capturing amazing shots of us all.

Will definitely recommend Fox! ❤️', 'Mostafa made our Cairo city trip extra special!', ""At the end of a very stressful tour through Cairo with our guide, we ended the day at the Pyramids of Giza. Actually, I didn't want to go on a camel ride tour at all, because I think the way many camel drivers treat the camels is absolutely cruel to animals. However, our Cairo tour guide introduced Mostafa to my mother and me. As soon as we met him, I realised that something was different here. He had a confident, calm and relaxed demeanour right from the start. He calmly explained to us everything we needed to know when dealing with camels and how to behave accordingly.One of the many wonderful features of Mostafa is that he does NOT use a whip or crop. This means that the communication between him and his camels is based on energy, calmness and self-confidence, and maybe a little slap on the butt if necessary ;-)Mostafa had funny and Instagrammable photo ideas during the tour, which he also did a great job of. He answered all my many many questions and explained them in detail.On the way back, he suddenly stopped and asked us to take off our hats and sunglasses in the last minutes of the tour. He also asked to close our eyes or leave them open, sit relaxed in the saddle and told us to completely empty our minds in the last minutes of the tour, to forget the stress of everyday life, our worries and other things and just let negative energy flow from us. In my whole life I have never felt so relaxed and at peace with myself as I did in those minutes, for a long time! As I write this, I actually have to shed a few tears.At the end of the tour, while we were still calm, he asked us to make a wish before we get off of the camels. And then the hour was already over :-(It went so incredibly fast, but in return it was incredibly great!Conclusion: Mostafa made our Cairo city trip extra special!We were already so stressed from the hectic trip through Cairo that I am so grateful to Mostafa for sending us this wonderful moment!Thank you Mostafa!

OK so you will get hassled to death by the Egyptians on their camels pestering you to take a ride.  If you do you must barter hard. Pay no more than EGP150 per person - for that you make it clear that the ride must be a minimum of 30 minutes.  They always expect a tip too!Photographically there’s no better opportunity than a camel ride.

Our 6yo son wanted to ride alone and Fox made sure to stay near and attentive to him to ensure he had a safe but amazing time. The tour was informative, funny and never rushed. Fox also took all the photos we could have asked for and made sure we didn’t miss any shots. Besides great history and trivia (which kept us laughing) he told us about daily life in Cairo and daily life of camel men. The best piece of advice he gave us was to “forget your name” for the time of the tour and to be transported in the magic of these ancient wonders. Being with Fox and made that possible!

Liberation Square (Midan El-Tahreer),Points of Interest & Landmarks,3.5,"In Front of the Egyptian Museum, Cairo 11511 Egypt","Not worth going out of your way, but there is a decent military statue and some lovely local markets in and around the square.","['OK for a visit', 'Not worth going out of your way, but there is a decent military statue and some lovely local markets in and around the square.', 'Very lively square', ""Tahrir Square - Cairo, Egypt 🇪🇬Known as a venue for political protests during 1900s with recent demonstrations taking place in 2011 & 2013, Tahrir quare, with the obelisk of Remeses 2 in it's center, and located in the heart of downtown Cairo, is a busy junction. Cairo's famous Egyptian museum, Arab league headquarters, historic Qasr-e-Ayni street, Qasr-e-Nil bridge(over the river Nile), Talat Harb Square and many governmnent buildings are located near Tahrir square."", 'Beware of scammers', ""The square itself isn't particularly pretty, we wanted to visit it and the surrounding area briefly because of its historical importance. The first troubling thing is that the traffic is really, really pedestrian unfriendly - we almost got run over! Instead of braking, a driver simply accelerated and honked his horn, although he had seen us crossing the Steasse for a long time. Near the Egyptian Museum, a man from may be 50 years approached us who wanted to dissuade us from walking to the Nile because he wanted to lure us into his sister's shop. He didn't take a 'no'. We were finally able to get rid of him and walked to the other side of the Place with direction to the Nile bridge with the lions. There another guy came up to us who said he was Dr. Maggi (or something like that) and be the head of the art museum. We didn't believe him, but he said that if we wanted to go to the Nile, he could show us the pedestrian underpass at the othet side of the street. We had no objection to that. He said that his son lived in Switzerland - which is unlikely to be true. As we walked on he told us about his daughter who is getting married tonight and we were invited. We had had enough and wanted to get rid of him. A short time later he stopped, we had arrived at his shop (On the corner of the building opposite InterContinental Cairo Semiramis). He wanted to give us his business card. We thought good, then we're rid of him. Of course things turned out differently: instead of handing over a business card, another guy sitting in his shop wrote our names on a papyrus, which he supposedly wanted to give us for free - which we immediately took to be a lie. They also wanted to offer us tea, we declined, we didn't sit down either. After a lot of back and forth, we were sort of forced to buy two inferior papyrus for $20 so we could leave the store. Dr. Maggi always said they wouldn't kill us, but we still didn't feel comfortable. Finally we managed to leave the store. By the way, there was no underpass. A short time later we found our way to the Nile, but our mood was towards the bad experience. On returning to our hotel, there was another minor rear-end collision - small dent or possibly nothing to see. The two drivers involved immediately attacked each other and other men immediately joined them and it degenerated into a mass brawl.The next day we walked around for a bit, but unfortunately it was similar. As a European, you can't walk two meters from the hotel without annoying merchants trying to sell you something or trying to lure you somewhere. A 'No' will not be accepted! We were also decently dressed. Would we choose a hotel in central Cairo again to explore the center? No, definitely not."", 'DO NOT APPROACH THIS PLACE', 'VERY discretely surrounded by secret police force and they will intimidate you to leave immediately and grab your camera to delete all photos taken.

A funny moment to note is that filming and taking pictures is prohibited - as if it's impossible to look into every corner of it via Google map 3D. We, however, came up to three policemen and, pretending ignorant of this rule, politely asked for a permission - and got it! Still, minutes after I started filming other three policemen approached me and sternly commanded to stop it. I obeyed - especially since I accomplished my mission.

A significant disappointment."", 'Had to see the place we heard so much about during the Arab Spring', 'Focal point of the 2011 Arab Spring uprising (you may have seen details on TV) occurred.   The Square originally was a celebration point after Egyptian was declared independence from English influence (rule).  The Arab spring revolt used this location because it was a point very close to the government house (parliament) in voicing their concerns to get Mobaric out of office.

Just over a year later, people filled the square again urging the army to take over government and dispose of then President Morsi. I found that in my last visit in 2020, the square was cordoned off in parts, there were a few people in the square and what appeared like a memorial was being built. One thing I noted was that the square had a better covering of grass than the first time I saw it back in 2010. It is a landmark of Cairo but there isn't much to see in the square."", 'All Protests Lead To Liberation Square', 'Despite its iconic status as the rallying point for protests in Cairo, Liberation Square is not really worth your while visiting.
