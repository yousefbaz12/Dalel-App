National Museum of Egyptian Civilization NEMC,History Museums,4.5,"Al Fustat Street Ain Al Sira, Cairo 17611 Egypt","This is a new museum, thoughtfully arranged chronologically to give one a good understanding of Egypt’s history. See the upper level first — it goes through 4000 years of Egyptian history — then proceed down to the mummies display (which is fascinating). Otherwise one emerges from the mummies at a rather random location on the upper level — and it’s confusing to figure out where to start. Go here before the Egyptian Museum because it provides a better explanation of Egyptian history. Once you have that basic background, the Egyptian Museum — which is somewhat disorganized — makes a bit more sense. Fridays  extended hours 6-9 pm, less busy than normal."

In order to be more than just a place where music and art are performed the National Cultural Centre wants to give space to learning and inspiration, to the exchange of ideas, the respect of a common cultural heritage, and a shared passion for the arts. It encourages interest for music and art in the younger generation by offering ballet, voice or instrumental classes for talented children or youths. Performances of ballet, operatic or symphonic works are staged with Egyptian companies or in cooperation with foreign ensembles or soloists. Seminars and cultural conferences covering a wide range of artistic and intellectual issues are held regularly. Opera House companies are frequently sent on tours to different Egyptian governorates to give the people in urban areas the chance to see national and international art performances. In March 1985, Former President Mubarak laid the first corner stone of the new Cairo Opera House which was to be built with the support of JICA, the Japan International Cooperation Agency. Careful planning by the Ministry of Culture in Cairo and the JICA produced a design suggestive of traditional Islamic architecture and blending in harmoniously with the surrounding buildings.
